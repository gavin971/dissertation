\chapter{Modeling Paradigm}\label{ch:paradigm}

The modeling paradigm with which this repository model and simulation 
platform are implemented are here described. Implications of the 
simulation platform architecture on the design of the repository model 
are discussed and the interfaces defining components of the repository 
model follow.

% The modeling paradigm is modular
%% components are within each other like a russian doll
%% Components include 
%% the waste itself,
%% the waste form,
%% the waste package,
%% the buffer,
%% the backfill, 
%% the tunnel lining,
%% the near field geology
%% and the far field geology
% Each component is defined by its interface
%% The interface is defined by the functions available to other models
%% The models within are interchangeable if they share an interface
% the interfaces between the models are based on information in and 
% out
