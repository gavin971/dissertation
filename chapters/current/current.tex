\chapter{Current Work}\label{ch:current}

\section{\Cyclus}

The \Cyclus framework discussed in chapter \ref{ch:paradigm} provides a fuel 
cycle simulation platform on which to initially develop and deploy the 
repository model that is the subject of this effort. As a part of this effort 
also under development, \Cyclus has been developed with an architecture that 
supports the goals of this effort and will continue to mature in parallel with 
the development of this model.

\subsection{Framework}

The \Cyclus framework is available, and the product of some quantity of work. 

This will be essential for implementing and testing the repository model.

\subsection{Available Models}

\Cyclus has a base set of models which are currently available and will support 
open and some closed fuel cycle simulations. These include a source and a sink 
facility model as well as recipe based reactor models, an enrichment facility, 
an intermediate storage facility, and a fleet of markets which direct material 
movement in the simulation.

Further fuel cycle facility models are being developed within \Cyclus  which 
will be essential for providing interesting scenarios for comparison via 
repository metrics. For a modified open cycle, a separations facility is 
necessary which will be capable of conducting arbitrarily complex chemical 
separations of used fuel. Similarly, an associated reprocessing facility  will 
be neccessary which is equipped to handle the so called `winery' problem of 
constructing critical fresh fuel assemblies appropriate for specific reactors 
from separated streams.


\section{GDSE Analysis}

Much of my future work is based on the parametric and regression analysis that
has begun with the base case Clay \gls{GDSE} model at \gls{ANL}.

\subsection{Sensitivity Analyses}

The Used Fuel Cycle Division has reported sensitivity results for various 
parameters as they affect Mean Annual Dose. I've looked at a 
few parameters too. I'll repeat those calculations for source term rather than 
dose in order to provide some graphs for the parameters below and more. I will 
be interested in coefficients defining the relationships between these 
parameters and source term over time for each isotope. 

\subsubsection{Cooling Time}

Extending the cooling time between discharge and emplacement results
in an altered waste stream. The emplacement capacity and resulting source term 
of this waste stream may be expected to differ from base case results. 
Nonetheless it was found that for the clay \gls{GDSE} model there was approximately 
no Mean Annual Dose sensitivity to the cooling period length.
\cite{nutt_generic_2011}
Since the cooling period will be modeled outside of the repository model within  
the \Cyclus analysis, this sensitivity will not be incorporated into the 
repository modeling effort at the heart of this work, but gives an intuition for 
appropriate sensitivity to altered waste streams.

It is expected that the cooling time alters heat based capacity.

\subsubsection{Burnup}

The burnup of a used fuel assembly results in an altered waste stream at the 
time of emplacement. It was found that for the clay \gls{GDSE} model, the mean 
annual dose sensitivity to waste form dissolution rate became more important 
linearly with increased burnup.  \cite{nutt_generic_2011}

It is expected that the burnup will alter heat based capacity.

\subsubsection{Drift Spacing}

Not much sensitivity.

\subsubsection{Vertical Distance to Aquifer}

Very sensitive to the distance between waste and the overlying aquifer. 
\cite{nutt_generic_2011}

\subsubsection{Vertical Darcy Velocity}

Sensitivity to vertical Darcy velocity is similar to the sensitivity to vertical 
distance to aquifer, for obvious reasons. \cite{nutt_generic_2011}

\subsubsection{Hypothetical Intersecting Fast Advective Pathway}

Sensitivity is very nuclide specific.\cite{nutt_generic_2011} 

\subsubsection{Dimensions of Hypothetical Fast Pathway}

That is, how important is the crack width?

J Ahn's PhD  thesis had some analytical answers to this question.

\subsubsection{Clay Porosity}

This should have a very slight linear effect. A coefficient needs to be derived 
from the relationship.

\subsubsection{Buffer Porosity}

This should have a very slight linear effect. A coefficient needs to be derived 
from the relationship.

\subsubsection{Waste Form Porosity}

That is, the porosity within the waste form initially.

\subsubsection{Waste Form Degradation Rate}

This will be irrelevant for cases with low burnup or no fast pathway. 

\subsubsection{Waste Form Release Mode}

Solubility limited? Continuous?

\subsubsection{Waste Package Degradation Rate}

This will be irrelevant for cases with low burnup or no fast pathway. 

\subsubsection{Waste Package Release Mode}

Solubility limited? Continuous?

\subsubsection{Nuclide Solubilities}

For each nuclide.

\subsubsection{Etc. }

There are many parameters I haven't thought of.

\subsection{Comparison with other geologies}

A short comparison with each of the other models representing specific geologies 
will be begun in order to determine the differences in results for similar 
parameters.


\section{SINDA Model Analysis}

\subsection{Review of Radel Analysis}

Maybe earlier in lit review instead. 

\subsection{Changing Geometry}

The tunnel geometry can be altered in two dimensions.

  altering the tunnel spacing and the vertical distance from the aquifer.}

\end{figure}

\subsection{Thermal Conductivities, etc.}

Sensitivity to various physical parameters of the model will be found. 

\section{LLNL Model Analysis}

An analysis similar to that conducted with the SINDA model will be conducted 
for the LLNL thermal model.

\section{Demonstration}

\subsection{Conceptual Model}

\subsubsection{Volumes}

Volumes are defined by their dimensions, surfaces, temperature, contained matter, and 
contained contaminants. 

Dimensions fully define the shape and magnitude of the volume.
\textbf{Volume shape? Can be more than just cylindrical?}

Interfaces are defined by a shared surface area, a flux type, and a flux 
direction. Any single volume may only interface with one inner and one outer 
volume. 

Contained matter must sum to the full volume of the volume.

\subsubsection{Matter}

This model treats matter in solid and liquid phases. Gaseous matter is not 
supported. 


Liquids are defined by their dynamic viscosities ($\mu$, [Pascal seconds]) and
by characteristic diffusivity ($d_i$, $[m^2/s]$) and solubility ($K$,$[kg/m^3]$) 
coefficients for each nuclide.  


Solids are assumed to be porous media and are defined by their porosity 
($n$, $\%$), tortuosity ($\tau$, $[-]$), and dry (bulk) density ($\rho$). 
Fracturation is dealt with separateea, a flux type, and a flux 
direction.  

\subsubsection{Connections}

Heat transfer connections include at least conductive and convective connections. 
Radiative and mass transfer heat connections will be a secondary extension to 
the modeling paradigm. 

Nuclide transport connections will include at least diffusive and advective 
connections. These will incorporate available porosity of the surface interface. 
Solubility limitations will be a characteristic of the mixing volume cell rather  
than the release pathway. 

\subsection{Mathematical Model}

\subsubsection{Mass Balances Within Cells}

This will describe the preliminary mixing model.

\subsection{Mass Transfer Boundaries}

\subsubsection{Heat Diffusion}

Equation, assumptions, B.C.s, I.C.s, solutions.

\subsubsection{Fluid/Contaminant Diffusion}

Equation, assumptions, B.C.s, I.C.s, solutions.

\subsubsection{Heat Advection}

Equation, assumptions, B.C.s, I.C.s, solutions.

\subsubsection{Fluid/Contaminant Advection}

\subsection{Computational Model}

\subsubsection{Simplified Models}
For a proof of principle, each repository subcomponent has been 
implemented with a first order model. The information passing system 
is thereby tested for completeness. 

\subsubsection{Information Exchange}
The information exchange paradigm must provide a comprehensive set of 
module boundary information as described in the mathematical model.
