\section{Summary}

\subsection{Motivation}

The need for this work has been shown by a summary of the current state of the 
art of fuel cycle simulator repository capabilities. The literature review 
concluded that most fuel cycle simulators lack repository analysis beyond basic 
mass tracking. The integrated radionuclide transport and thermal analysis to be 
pursued in this work will provide a currently unavailable tool for disposal 
system analysis. An immediate need for such a tool has been expressed in the 
\gls{UFD} campaign roadmap for this year in which an interface with the \gls{SA} 
campaign was noted as a primary goal. 

\subsection{Current Work}

Development of the \Cyclus fuel cycle simulator has generated a tool with which 
the systems analysis aspects of this work will be conducted. Development of the  
fundamental repository module concept appropriate for modular integration with 
\Cyclus has laid the foundation for a software effort which will deliver a 
library of disposal system component models capable of analyzing current 
disposal concepts of interest both domestically and internationally.

\section{Future Work}

\subsection{Base Case Development}

% Base Case Milestone

\subsubsection{Base Case Concept}

  % Concept

    % uniform unfractured permeable porous medium

      % reducing geochemistry

      The base case concept will model a generic, isotropic, permeable porous 
      geological medium with reducing geochemistry. This model will be 
      appropriate for clay and salt geologies. The fracturation in the geologies  
      of the granite and deep borehole concepts will not be appropriately 
      modeled in the base case unless an equivalent porous medium calculation is 
      conducted external to the code. The incorporation of fracture models will 
      follow in subsequent extensions to the base case.
  
    % WF : glass 

      % alteration

      % temperature limit

    % WF : uox 

      % cladding limit

      % corrosion

      A waste form component module capable of modeling two canonical waste
      form concepts will be developed. It will be modeled with a rate based 
      dissolution model and will be equipped with a heat limit which may 
      constrict the waste form loading. Such a waste form component module will 
      be appropriate for borosilicate glass, the dissolution of which is 
      dominated by a surface alteration rate. It will be appropriate also for a 
      ceramic oxide waste form, the dissolution of which is dominated by a 
      corrosive degradation rate.

    % WP : steel

      % fractional
      
      A general, probabilistic waste package failure model will be employed.  
      From a user-defined time dependent probability distribution (of which the 
      Weibull distribution is one), a waste package failure vector will be 
      populated, which assigns a failure time to each waste package object. As 
      the simulation progresses, these waste packages will fail discretely, 
      trigerring the initial degradation attack for the waste forms within them.

    % Buffer : Purely Diffusive Transport 
      
      % permeable porous medium

      The buffer component will be modeled as an isotropic permeable porous 
      medium which is chemically reducing and in which transport is diffusion 
      dominated  and solubility limited.  For the base case, this model will 
      involve only diffusive transport. Extensions to this model will include a 
      model for sorption as well as fracturation and advective transport.  

    % Heat limits at buffer and rock boundary 

      Heat limits in the base case will be calculated at the boundary between 
      the waste package and buffer as well as the boundary between the buffer or  
      backfill and the rock matrix.

\subsubsection{Base Case Abstraction }

  % Regression Analysis

  Abstraction will be conducted for each of the models listed above to identify  
  potential simplifying assumptions. For example, diffusive contaminant 
  transport in  permeable porous media will likely utilize the sensitivity 
  analysis results in section \ref{sec:current} to assume that the mean annual 
  dose is not sensitive to the horizontal spacing between drifts. Appropriate 
  conceptual models will employ these simplifications to streamline 
  calculations.

\subsection{Sensitivity Analysis}

A sensitivity analysis underway to arrive at simplified dominant physics 
relationships between the various input parameters of the simulation. 

\subsubsection{Nuclide Transport}

These are the independent parameters I'm interested in.

A TABLE, perhaps. Including parametric domain.

This is how I'll vary them.

Show that these provide a largely complete set of input variables to define 
nuclide transport. Discuss variables that are being neglected for simplicity, 
perhaps to be added later. 

\subsubsection{Heat Evolution}

These are the independent parameters I'm interested in.

A TABLE, perhaps. Including parametric domaie.

This is how I'll vary them.

Show that these provide a largely complete set of input variables to define heat 
evolution. Discuss variables that are being neglected for simplicity, perhaps to 
be added later. 

\subsection{Mathematical Model Abstraction}

Using the results of these sensitivity analyses, regression analysis will be 
performed to develop simplified parametric dependencies for all independent 
variables for each model. 

\subsection{Computational Model Development}

The development of the computational model will begin with simplistic models of  
the fundamental components of the detailing the phyical phenomena at work vs.  
the conceptual and mathematical models available, listed in order of complexity.

packages and waste forms.

noble metals that did not dissolve in the Echem dissolution Metal alloy from 
aqueous reprocessing:  Includes undissolved solids and transition metal fission 
products

includes iodine volatilized during chopping, which is then gettered during 
head-end processing of used fuels


\paragraph{Separated Streams} Other:  Examples include radionuclides removed 
from other waste forms (e.g., Cs/Sr, I, C), as well as new waste forms such as a 
salt waste form

\paragraph{Classes A, B, and C waste} Lower Than High Level Waste (LTHLW): 
Includes Classes A, B, and C

\paragraph{GTCC LTHLW}  Greater Than Class C (GTCC)


\subsubsection{Demonstration}

Show that the complete model behaves in agreement with the more detailed model 
on which it was based. Else, iterate through sensitivity analyses, model 
abstraction, and computational development until the model is validated. 



\subsubsection{Extension}

This disposal system will at this point be extended to include a fleet of 
predefined model implementations to represent some canonical waste forms, 
packages, buffers, and clay types.  

\subsubsection{Fuel Cycle Analysis}

Show some various fuel cycles have different repository needs and metrics.  
Specifically, compare a closed fuel cycle, an open one, and at least one 
modified fuel cycle. 




% UFD developing metrics for the fct program option screening these and perhaps 
% other metrics will be included.
