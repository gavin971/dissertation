\chapter{Categorization of Models}\label{ch:categorization}
The goal of this chapter is to categorize the available analytical and 
computational models into their salient characteristics according to the 
phenomena we are interested in modeling. For example, a table will be listed 
here detailing the phyical phenomena at work vs. the conceptual and 
mathematical models available, listed in order of complexity.
