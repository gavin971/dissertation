\chapter{Categorization of Models}\label{ch:categorization}

The goal of this chapter is to categorize the available analytical and 
computational models into their salient characteristics according to the 
phenomena this modeling effort may address. For example, a table will be listed 
here detailing the phyical phenomena at work vs. the conceptual and 
mathematical models available, listed in order of complexity.

\section{Fractures}

\subsection{Explicit Discrete Fracture Formulation}

This modeling formulation is complex and requires detailed knowledge of the 
candidate lithology. While an extensibility to include such a model will be 
retained in the repository system, it is well out of scope of the level of 
detail being sought by this nature of simulation. 

\subsection{Dual-Continuum Formulation}

The dual continuum formulation for either porosity or permeability allows a 
network of cracks to be  

It is one of the most widely employed models of fracture flow 
\cite{diodato_compendium_1994}.

\subsection{Discrete Fracture Network}
\subsection{Single Equivalent Continuum}

\subsection{Unsaturated or Multiphase Flow}
While some candidate repository geologies such as salt and granite are presumed 
to be unsaturated, the base case geology being modeled in this work is assumed 
to be saturated.


\section{Mixing}

\subsection{Precipitates}

\subsection{Dissolved Concentrations}



\section{Matter Dissolution}

\subsection{ Atomistic }

\subsection{ Molecular Dynamics } 

\subsection{ Staged }

Various stages of matter dissolution may include the initial attack, alteration, 
maturation, evolution, etc.

\subsection{ SWF/UFD/NEAMS data}

These will presumably give simplified constant rates.
