I am grateful to a number of extraordinary professors and colleagues at the 
Universities of Wisconsin and Chicago who have inspired and encouraged me. Among  
them, I am especially indebted to my advisor, Paul~P.H.~Wilson, for his invaluable 
technical and practical guidance. I am also grateful to my laboratory advisor, 
Mark~Nutt, who has been an outstanding resource for the work at hand and from whom 
I look forward to learning a great deal in the upcoming phase of my research.
