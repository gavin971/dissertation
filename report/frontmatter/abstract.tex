As the United States and other nuclear nations consider alternative fuel cycles 
and waste disposal options simultaneously, an integrated fuel cycle and generic disposal system 
analysis tool grows increasingly necessary for informing nuclear spent nuclear 
fuel management policy. The long term performance characteristics of deep 
geologic disposal concepts are affected by heat and radionuclide release 
characteristics sensitive to disposal system choices as well as variable spent 
fuel compositions associated  with alternative fuel cycles.  Computational 
tools capable of simulating the dynamic, heterogeneous spent fuel isotopics 
resulting from alternative nuclear fuel cycles and fuel cycle transition 
scenarios are, however, 
lacking in repository modeling  options.  This work has resulted in \Cyder, a 
generic repository software library appropriate for
system analysis of potential future fuel cycle deployment scenarios.  By emphasizing 
modularity and speed, \Cyder is capable of representing the dominant 
physics of candidate geologic host media, repository designs, and engineering components. 
Robust and flexible integration with the \Cyclus fuel cycle simulator
enables this analysis in the context of fuel cycle options.
