As the United States and other nuclear nations consider alternative fuel cycles 
and waste disposal options simultaneously, an integrated fuel cycle and generic disposal system 
analysis tool is increasingly necessary for informing nuclear spent 
fuel policy. Disposal performance metrics are affected by heat and radionuclide release 
characteristics sensitive to disposal system choices as well as variable spent 
fuel compositions associated  with alternative fuel cycles.  Computational 
tools capable of simulating the dynamic, heterogeneous spent fuel isotopics 
resulting from transition scenarios and alternative fuel cycles are, however, 
lacking in repository modeling  options.  This work has resulted in \Cyder, a 
generic repository software library appropriate for systems analysis.  By emphasizing 
modularity and speed, \Cyder is capabable of illuminating the distinct dominant 
physics of candidate repository geologies, designs, and engineering components. 
Robust and flexible integration with the \Cyclus fuel cycle simulator
enables this analysis in the context of fuel cycle options.
