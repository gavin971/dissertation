I am grateful to a number of extraordinary professors and colleagues at the 
Universities of Wisconsin and Chicago who have inspired and encouraged me.  
Among  them, I am especially indebted to my advisor, Professor 
Paul~P.H.~Wilson, for his invaluable technical and practical guidance. I am 
also grateful to my laboratory advisor, W.~Mark~Nutt who has been an 
outstanding resource for the work at hand. Special gratitude also goes to 
Professor Jean~M.~Bahr, whose detailed attention to my preliminary report was of 
exceptional value. 

So too, my colleagues Kyle~M.~Oliver, Matthew~J.~Gidden and Robert~W.~Carlsen 
have been essential in the growth of the \Cyclus project as well as my 
collaborative abilities.  Additionally, all confidence I have in these results 
is owed to software practices inspired by my friends among The Hacker Within 
and Software Carpentry. At the risk of neglecting someone, I must thank, in 
particular, Greg Wilson, Kyle Oliver, Animal1, Wolfman, Slayer, Scopz, Nico,  
BlackBeard, BlondeBeard, and RedBeard.
