I am grateful to a number of extraordinary professors and colleagues at the 
Universities of Wisconsin and Chicago who have inspired and encouraged me.  
Among them, I am especially indebted to my advisor, Professor Paul~P.H.~Wilson, 
for his invaluable technical and practical guidance. He has been a dedicated 
ally, always generous with analytical perspectives, far-ranging enthusiasm, and 
deep concern for the professional and personal well being of his students. I 
am similarly grateful to my laboratory advisor, W.~Mark~Nutt, an outstanding 
mentor who has provided critical direction and resources for the work at 
hand. Special gratitude also goes to Professor Jean~M.~Bahr, whose expertise 
and detailed attention to drafts of this work were of exceptional value.  

So too, my colleagues Kyle~M.~Oliver, Matthew~J.~Gidden and Robert~W.~Carlsen 
have been essential in the success of the \Cyclus project as well the growth of 
my collaborative abilities. Alexander Bara also deserves thanks for the summer 
he contributed to the STC database. Additionally, all confidence I have in 
these results is owed to software practices inspired by my friends among The 
Hacker Within and Software Carpentry. At the risk of neglecting someone, I must 
thank, in particular, Greg Wilson, Animal1, Wolfman, Slayer, Scopz, Nico,  
BlackBeard, BlondeBeard, and RedBeard.
