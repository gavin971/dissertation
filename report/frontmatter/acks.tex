I am grateful to a number of extraordinary professors and colleagues at the 
Universities of Wisconsin and Chicago who have inspired and encouraged me. Among  
them, I am especially indebted to my advisor, Paul~P.H.~Wilson, for his invaluable 
technical and practical guidance. I am also grateful to my laboratory advisor, 
Mark~Nutt who has been an outstanding resource for the work at hand.

All confidence I have in these results is owed to my friends among The Hacker 
Within and Software Carpentry. At the risk of neglecting someone, I must thank, 
in particular, Greg Wilson, Kyle Oliver, Animal1, Wolfman, Slayer, Scopz, Nico,  
BlackBeard, BlondeBeard, and RedBeard.
