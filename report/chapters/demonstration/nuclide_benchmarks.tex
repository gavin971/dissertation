\section{Radionuclide Transport Benchmarks}\label{sec:nuclide_benchmarks}

As described in Section \ref{sec:nuclide_models}, hydrologic contaminant 
transport in \Cyder is implemented with four interchangeable  methods in a 
modular software design. These modeling options alternately optimize speed and 
fidelity in representations of barrier components within the repository concept 
(i.e. waste form, waste package, buffer, near field geology, and far field 
geology)\cite{huff_hydrologic_2013}.  Simplistic models include a congruent 
release component degradation model and a mixed cell control volume model. For 
systems in which the flow can be assumed constant, a medium fidelity lumped 
parameter dispersion model is implemented. Also implemented is a Leij et al. 
solution to the advection dispersion equation for Cauchy boundary condition 
\cite{leij_analytical_1991, van_genuchten_analytical_1982}.  

Analyses in Table \ref{tab:nuclide_bench_tab} were conducted to compare the 
performance of these radionuclide transport models with more detailed results from the 
Clay \gls{GDSE}.
