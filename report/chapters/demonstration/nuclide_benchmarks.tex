\section{Radionuclide Transport Validation}\label{sec:nuclide_benchmarks}

As described in Section \ref{sec:nuclide_models}, hydrologic contaminant 
transport in \Cyder is implemented with four interchangeable  methods in a 
modular software design. These modeling options alternately optimize speed and 
fidelity in representations of barrier components within the repository concept 
(i.e. waste form, waste package, buffer, and geologic medium)\cite{huff_hydrologic_2013}.  Simplistic models include a congruent 
release component degradation rate model and a mixed cell control volume model. For 
systems in which the flow can be assumed constant, a medium fidelity lumped 
parameter dispersion model is implemented. Also implemented is a Leij et al. 
solution to the advection dispersion equation for Cauchy boundary condition 
\cite{leij_analytical_1991, van_genuchten_analytical_1982}.  

Analyses in Table \ref{tab:nuclide_bench_tab} were conducted to compare the 
performance of these radionuclide transport models with more detailed results from the 
Clay \gls{GDSE}.
