\subsubsection{Reference Sorption Coefficient Sensitivity}

In the parametric analysis of \Cyder performance, it was shown that sorption 
sensitivity behavior closely matched that of the \gls{GDSM} sensitivity 
behaviors. Specifically, in Figure \ref{fig:}, increasing the retardation 
coefficient results in a smooth but dramatic turnover.

points are funky. I know how to deal with it, I just have to re-run this 
sim-set.)}
