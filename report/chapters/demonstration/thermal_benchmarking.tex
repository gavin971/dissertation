\section{Thermal Benchmarking} \label{sec:thermal_benchmarking}



For dynamic thermal capacity analysis in Cyder, a transient model utilizes a 
linear approximation of heat based capacity quickly for each arbitrary waste 
stream offered to the repository. As described in section 
\ref{sec:thermal_models}, this relies on a thermal reference database 
of repository heat evolution curves covering the thermal coefficient range of 
the main geologies of interest and over a range of realistic waste package 
spacings. 

Analyses in Table \ref{tab:thermal_bench_tab} were conducted to compare the 
performance of these thermal models with more detailed results from the 
\gls{LLNL} analytical MathCAD model.
