\section{Thermal Transport Validation}\label{sec:thermal_benchmarks}

Analyses in this section were conducted to compare the performance of the 
\gls{STC} thermal model in \Cyder with more detailed results of the \gls{LLNL} 
thermal model. The \Cyder model captures the trends of the \gls{LLNL} model for 
the dominant physics of heat transport in a repository.
