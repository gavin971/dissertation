\section{Waste Isotopics Sensitivity Study}\label{sec:isotopics}
The waste constituent isototopes, $i$, which vary among fuel cycles have a 
strong affect on the decay heat burden of the repository. 

In the creation of the \gls{STC} database, a number of high heat contributing 
isotopes were considered. In this study, the spent fuel composition of the 
waste is waste package spacing was varied across a number of values for each 
isotope, $i$, limiting radius $r_{calc}$, thermal diffusivity $\alpha_{th}$, 
and thermal conductivity $K_{th}$, considered.  

Figure \ref{fig:isotopics_sensitivity} shows the comparison between two common 
spent fuel constituents as well as a CsSr waste form that might be generated 
by a reprocessing process. The specific temperature changes due to these wastes 
is given as STC per GWh generated by that waste.
