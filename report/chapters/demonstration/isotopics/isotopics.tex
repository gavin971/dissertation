\section{Waste Package Spacing Sensitivity Study}\label{sec:spacing}
The waste package spacing, $s$ of geologic repository concept effects the areal 
decay heat burden in the repository and has a strong effect on the thermal 
energy deposited per unit area in the medium. 

In the creation of the \gls{STC} database, the waste package spacing was varied 
across a number of values for each isotope, $i$, limiting 
radius $r_{calc}$, thermal diffusivity $\alpha_{th}$, and thermal conductivity $K_{th}$, considered.  By 
varying the waste package spacing of the repository model from $0.1-5 [m]$
this sensitivity analysis succeeds in capturing the domain of 
waste package spacings present in geologic repository concepts under 
consideration.

spacing decreases areal thermal energy deposition

Figure \ref{fig:Cm242alpha_kth_low} shows the trend, visible for all isotopes, 
that increased waste package spacing of a medium decreases thermal energy 
deposition in the near field. This indicates that waste package spacing is 
an important parameter for repository concept design.
