\section{Radionuclide Transport Base Cases}\label{sec:nuclide_base_cases}
\subsection{Basic Transport and Containment Problem Specification}
Basic transport and containment base cases were conducted to verify basic 
transport and contaminant behavior of all the radionuclide transport models at 
each component interface. These tests neglected thermal transport and capacity 
estimation to simplify the verification procedure.  

The problem design includes : 
\begin{itemize}
\item{A source facility providing one waste stream per timestep}
\item{An initial capacity of 5 1kg waste streams}
\item{Waste form Components each accepting 1 waste stream} 
\item{Corresponding waste package Components, one per waste form}
\item{A buffer Component}
\item{A far field Component}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Degradation Rate Model}
The Degradation Rate model should not release contaminants if the degradation 
rate is 0. If the degradation rate is nonzero, however, contaminants should 
become available immediately to the adjacent components, traveling quickly 
across the interfaces. 

To observe these behaviors, four simulations were run to demonstrate that total 
containment resulted from a degradation rate of 0 and that congruent release 
resulted from nonzero degradation rates. A description of these verification 
cases can be found in Table \ref{tab:lp_base}. The 0 degradation rate component was 
different for each of the four cases. This resulted in total containment at the 
Waste Form, Waste Package, Buffer, and Far Field interfaces respectively. 
Results of these base cases can be found in Figures 
\ref{fig:drIwf5} through \ref{fig:drIVff0}.

\subsubsection{Mixed Cell Model}
The Mixed Cell model behaves similarly to the Degradation Rate 
model, when sorption and solubility limitation in that model are disabled (as 
in Figures \ref{fig:mcI} through \ref{fig:mcIff0}. When they are 
enabled, however, expected to demonstrate sorption limited and solubility 
limited transport as in Figures \ref{fig:mcIIIall} through \ref{fig:mcII}. The extent to which sorption and solubility limitation meet 
expectations is addressed in this base case.

Dual and single parameter verification cases were run to explore the effects of 
sorption and solubility limitation both separately and together.  Results from 
two of these base cases can be found in Figures \ref{fig:mcI} through 
\ref{fig:mcII}. The transport method between mixed cell components was the 
source term method, for speed and clarity of result accuracy.

\subsubsection{Lumped Parameter Model}
The Lumped Parameter model, with its three formulations (Exponential Model, 
Dispersion Model, and Piston flow Model) is not expected to receive 
contaminants if the porosity or advective velocity are zero. Else, however, 
contaminants are expected to  become available to the adjacent components 
according to the functional forms of the formulations. 

To observe the behaviors of each of the three formulations and to demonstrate 
full containment in cases where it is expected, simulations were run to 
investigate the impact of using various models. Results of these base cases can be found in Figures 
\ref{fig:lpBegin} through \ref{fig:lpEnd}.

The transit time that parameterizes these models could be based on radioactive 
tracer experiments in the field. Figures \ref{fig:lp_t_t_begin} 
\ref{fig:lp_t_t_end} demonstrate the dependence of the resulting transport on 
transit time parameteriztion. These profiles match closely with the expected 
analytical results demonstrated in Maloszewski and Zuber 
\cite{zuber_lumped_1985}.

\subsubsection{One Dimensional Permeable Porous Medium Model}
The One Dimensional PPM Model does not release contaminants if the porosity is 
zero or if both the reference diffusivity and advective velocity are zero. 
Else, however, contaminants are expected to  become available to the adjacent 
components according to the analytical form of the solution. The solution is 
only valid for advection and dispersion values within a realistic range, and 
the model accordingly can only be demonstrated for a very slow transport case. 

Issues with floating point representable rational numbers, conversion, and 
rounding within the treatment of material objects in the \Cyclus simulator 
were encountered with this model. Crudely handled tolerances in the \Cyclus simulator 
caused difficulty tracking and conserving very small quantites  in the \Cyder 
library.

A number of efforts to improve these results are forthcoming, including a 
refactoring of the treatment of tolerances within \Cyclus as well as a 
refactoring of the treatment of timesteps within \Cyder. Specifically, 
calculations in \Cyder will be conducted over longer timescales than the native 
month-long timescale of \Cyclus timesteps, somewhat alleviating the need to 
track many miniscule material objects. 

To observe the behavior of the solution and to demonstrate full containment in 
cases where it is expected, simulations were run. An example simulation, is 
shown in Figures \ref{fig:1dI} through \ref{fig:1dIV}.
