\section{Radionuclide Transport Base Cases}\label{sec:nuclide_base_cases}
\subsection{Basic Transport and Containment Problem Specification}
The basic transport and containment base cases verify basic transport and 
contaminant behavior of all the radionuclide transport models at each component 
interface. These tests neglected thermal transport and capacity estimation to 
simplify the verification procedure. 

The problem design includes : 
\begin{itemize}
\item{A source facility providing one waste stream per timestep}
\item{A legislated repository capacity of 5 1kg waste streams}
\item{A waste form Component} 
\item{A waste package Component}
\item{A buffer Component}
\item{A far field Component}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Degradation Rate Model}
The Degradation Rate model should not release contaminants if the degradation 
rate is 0. If the degradation rate is nonzero, however, contaminants should 
become available immediately to the adjacent components, traveling quickly 
accross the interfaces. 

To observe these behaviors, four simulations were run to demonstrate that total 
containment resulted from a degradation rate of 0 and that conrguent release 
resulted from nonzero degradation rates. The 0 degradation rate component was 
different for each of the four cases. This resulted in total containment at the 
Waste Form, Waste Package, Buffer, and Far Field interfaces respectively.
