\section{Radionuclide Transport Base Cases}\label{sec:nuclide_base_cases}
\subsection{Basic Transport and Containment Problem Specification}
Basic transport and containment base cases were conducted to verify basic 
transport and contaminant behavior of all the radionuclide transport models at 
each component interface. These tests neglected thermal transport and capacity 
estimation to simplify the verification procedure.  

The problem design includes : 
\begin{itemize}
\item{A source facility providing one waste stream per timestep}
\item{A legislated repository capacity of 5 1kg waste streams}
\item{A waste form Component} 
\item{A waste package Component}
\item{A buffer Component}
\item{A far field Component}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Degradation Rate Model}
The Degradation Rate model should not release contaminants if the degradation 
rate is 0. If the degradation rate is nonzero, however, contaminants should 
become available immediately to the adjacent components, traveling quickly 
accross the interfaces. 

To observe these behaviors, four simulations were run to demonstrate that total 
containment resulted from a degradation rate of 0 and that conrguent release 
resulted from nonzero degradation rates. A description of these verification 
cases can be found in Table \ref{tab:dr_base}. The 0 degradation rate component was 
different for each of the four cases. This resulted in total containment at the 
Waste Form, Waste Package, Buffer, and Far Field interfaces respectively. 
Results of these base cases can be found in Figures 
\ref{fig:drIwf5} through \ref{fig:drIVff0}.

\subsubsection{Mixed Cell Model}
The Mixed Cell model behaves exactly similarly to the Degradation Rate 
model, when sorption and solubility limitation in that model are disabled. When they are 
enabled, however, expected to demonstrate sorption limited and solubility 
limited transport. The extent to which sorption and solubility limitation meet 
expectations is addressed in this base case.

Dual and single parameter verification cases were run to explore the effects of sorption and 
solubility limitation both separately and together. A description of these verification 
cases can be found in Table \ref{tab:mc_base}. 
Results of these base cases can be found in Figures \ref{fig:mcI} through 
\ref{fig:mcIV}.

\subsubsection{Lumped Parameter Model}
The Lumped Parameter model, with its three formulations (Exponential Model, 
Dispersion Model, and Piston flow Model) is not expected to receive 
contaminants if the porosity or advective velocity are zero. Else, however, 
contaminants are expected to  become available to the adjacent components 
according to the functional forms of the formulations. 

To observe the behaviors of each of the three formulations and to demonstrate 
full containment in cases where it is expected, simulations were run
according to the descriptions in Table \ref{tab:lp_base}.
Results of these base cases can be found in Figures 
\ref{fig:lpEMI} through \ref{fig:lpPFMIV}.

\subsubsection{One Dimensional Advective Dispersive Model}
The One Dimensional Advective Dispersive Model contaminants if the porosity is 
zero or if both the reference diffusivity and advective velocity are zero. 
Else, however, contaminants are expected to  become available to the adjacent 
components according to the analytical form of the solution.

To observe the behavior of the solution and to demonstrate full containment in 
cases where it is expected, simulations were run according to the descriptions 
in Table \ref{tab:1d_base}.  Results of these base cases can be found in 
Figures \ref{fig:1dI} through \ref{fig:1dIV}.
