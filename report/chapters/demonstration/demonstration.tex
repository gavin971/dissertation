\chapter{Demonstration Cases and Benchmarking}\label{ch:demonstration}

Basic verification of the integrated behavior of the components in the \Cyder 
model was achieved with a suite of toy base cases and a suite of physics 
demonstrating validation comparisons. 

The toy base cases were simplistic simulations that were intended 
to verify the fundamental behavior of the mass balance models and mass transfer 
modes. These aphysical but informative simulations were run to asses the simplistic 
behavior of an assembly of \Cyder components within a simplistic \Cyclus 
simulation.

The physics demonstrations, on the other hand, sought to demonstrate that the 
dominant physics of repository performance were captured as intended by the 
various contaminant and thermal transport models implemented in \Cyder.
