\section{Contributions}

This work has provided a repository anaylsis module for fuel cycle analysis 
that is the first of its kind. That is, it provides the first generic geology 
repository model integrated dynamically within a fuel cycle simulation code.

The Cyder source code in which these models are implemented as well as 
associated documentation are freely available to interested researchers and 
potential model developers. The application programming interface to this 
software library is intentionally general, facilitating the incorporation of 
the models presented here within external software tools in need of a 
multicomponent repository model.

Furthermore, this work contributes to an expanding ecosystem of computational 
models available for use with the Cyclus fuel cycle simulator. This hydrologic 
nuclide transport library, by virtue of its capability to modularly integrate 
with the Cyclus fuel cycle simulator has laid the foundation for integrated 
disposal option analysis in the context of fuel cycle options.
