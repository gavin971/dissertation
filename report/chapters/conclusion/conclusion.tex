\section{Contributions}

This work has provided a generic geologic repository library apropriate for 
systems analysis. Capable of thermal transport, hydrologic contaminant 
transport, and integrated dynamically within a fuel cycle simulation code,
\Cyder is the first of its kind. 

A set of basic capabilities within the \Cyder library have been developed and
validated and an assortment of advanced features and data are functional.
The \Cyder source code in which these models are implemented as well as 
associated documentation are freely available to interested researchers and 
potential model developers. The application programming interface to this 
software library is intentionally general, facilitating the incorporation of 
the models presented here within external software tools in need of a 
multicomponent repository model.

Furthermore, this work contributes to an expanding ecosystem of computational 
models available for use with the Cyclus fuel cycle simulator. This hydrologic 
nuclide transport library, by virtue of its capability to modularly integrate 
with the Cyclus fuel cycle simulator has laid the foundation for integrated 
disposal option analysis in the context of fuel cycle options.
