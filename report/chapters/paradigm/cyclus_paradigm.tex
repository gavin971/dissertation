\section{\Cyclus Simulator Paradigm }

The \Cyclus project \cite{wilson_cyclus:_2012} at the \gls{UW} Madison is the 
simulation framework in which this repository model is designed to 
operate.  Modular features within this software architecture provide a 
great deal of flexibility, both in terms of modifying the underlying 
modeling algorithms and exchanging components of a fuel cycle system.

The \Cyclus fuel cycle simulator is the  result of lessons learned 
from experience with previous nuclear fuel cycle simulation platforms.  
The modeling paradigm follows the transaction of discrete quanta of 
material among discrete facilities, arranged in a geographic and 
institutional framework, and trading in
flexible markets. Key concepts in the design of \Cyclus include open
access to the simulation engine, modularity with regard to
functionality, and relevance to both scientific and policy
analyses. The combination of modular encapsulation within the
software architecture and dynamic module loading allows for robust but 
flexible reconfiguration of the basic building blocks of a simulation 
without alteration of the simulation framework.  

The modeling paradigm adopted by \Cyclus includes a number of
fundamental concepts that comprise the foundation on which other, more
flexible, design choices have been made. 

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Dynamic Module Loading}

The ability to dynamically load independently constructed modules is a
heavy focus of \Cyclus development. Dynamically-loadable modules are
the primary mechanism for extending \Cyclus' capability. The primary
benefit of this approach is encapsulation: the core of the code is
completely independent of the individual models. Thus, any
customization or extension is implemented only in the loadable
module. A secondary benefit of this encapsulation is the ability for
contributors to choose different distribution and licensing strategies
for their contributions. By allowing models to have varied
availability, the security concerns of developers can be
assuaged (See Figure \ref{fig:repo}). 

\begin{figure}[htb!]

  \caption[Schematic of the \Cyclus code repository.]{The \Cyclus code repository allows for varied accessibility 
  \cite{wilson_cyclus:_2012}.}
  \label{fig:repo}
\end{figure}

Finally, this strategy allows individual developers to
explore different levels of complexity within their modules, including
wrapping other simulation tools as loadable modules within the \Cyclus 
framework. This last benefit of dynamically-loadable modules addresses 
another goal of \Cyclus: ubiquity amongst its potential user base. By
engineering \Cyclus to easily handle varying levels of complexity, a single
simulation engine can be used by both users interested in big-picture policy
questions as well as users focused on more detailed, technical
analyses.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection{Encapsulation}

\Cyclus implements an encapsulated structure that takes advantage of 
object-oriented software design techniques in order to create an 
extensible and modular user and developer interface. A primary 
workhorse for this implementation is the notion of dynamic module 
loading in combination with  well defined module interfaces within 
a region, institution, and facility  hierarchy. In this paradigm, 
the shared interface of polymorphic objects is abstracted from the 
logic of their instantiation by the model definition they inherit.  

In this way, \Cyclus allows a level of abstraction to exist between 
the simulation and model instantiation as well as between model 
instantiation and behavior.  An interface defines the set of shared 
functions of a set of subclasses in an abstract superclass. In \Cyclus
main superclasses are Regions, Institutions, and Facilities 
while their subclasses are the concrete available model types (e.g. a 
RecipeReactorFacility). See Figure \ref{fig:modularity}.

The interface for the FacilityModel class is the set of 
virtual functions declared in the Facility class such as getName, 
getID, executeOrder(), sendMaterial(), receiveMaterial() etc.  Through 
such an interface, the members of a subclass can be treated as 
interchangeable (polymorphic) instantiations of their shared 
superclass.

  \caption[Module Interfaces and Encapsulation in \Cyclus.]{Modules are defined solely 
  by their interfaces in a modular paradigm and can be arbitrarily 
  interchanged with modules posessing equivalent interfaces.}
  \label{fig:modularity}
\end{figure}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection{Modularity and Extensibility}

A modular code must have the traits of encapsulation and abstraction 
appropriate for a user or developer to flexibly make alterations to 
the simulation performance with minimal modification to the code. An 
extensible code should be both robustly suited to the addition of 
classes and subclasses as well as suited to communication with other codes.
In \Cyclus, addition of new models by dynamic loading is possible without 
any alteration of the software core. The modular design of \Cyclus stresses
avoidance of rigidity, in which changes to the code are potentially difficult, 
and fragility, in which changes to the code are potentially damaging.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Market-based Material Transactions}

The foundation of a simulation is a commodity market that collects 
offers and requests and matches them according to some algorithm.  The 
user is able to select which type of algorithm is used for each market 
by selecting a MarketModel and configuring it with a particular set of 
parameters defined by that MarketModel.  Changing the parameters of a 
market changes its performance and selecting a different MarketModel 
completely changes its behavior.

The transaction of nuclear materials takes place in markets that act
as brokers matching a set of requests for material with a set of
offers for that material. A variety of market models are available
to perform this brokerage role. It is important to note that each
market is defined for a single commodity and acts independently of
other markets. Once the requests and offers have been matched by each
market in a simulation, the facilities exchange material objects.

Facilities are deployed to issue offers and requests in these markets.  
Like markets, the user may select which type of algorithm is used for 
each facility by selecting a FacilityModel and configuring it with a 
particular set of parameters defined by that FacilityModel.  Changing 
the parameters of a facility changes its performance and selecting a 
different FacilityModel completely changes its behavior.  Unlike 
markets, multiple independent instances of each facility configuration 
can be deployed to represent individual facilities.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Discrete Materials and Facilities}

The repository model that is the subject of this work is a facility model 
within the \Cyclus simulation paradigm.  The \Cyclus modeling infrastructure is 
designed such that every facility in a global nuclear fuel cycle is treated and 
acts individually.  Each facility has two fundamental tasks: the transaction of 
goods or products with other facilities and the transformation of those goods 
or products from an input form to an output form.  For example, a reactor will 
receive fresh fuel assemblies from a fuel fabrication facility, transform them 
to used fuel assemblies using some approximation of the reactor physics, and 
supply those used fuel assemblies to a storage facility. In this manner, 
facilities can be thought of as black boxes in the simulation which request and 
produce resources as in Figure \ref{fig:facility} 

\begin{figure}[htb!]
  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{./chapters/paradigm/facility.eps}
  \end{center}
  \caption[\Cyclus FacilityModel offer and request interface.]{\Cyclus FacilityModels make offers ($1\cdots M$) and requests ($1\cdots N$).}
  \label{fig:facility}
\end{figure}


A facility configuration is created by selecting a FacilityModel and 
defining the parameters for that facility configuration.
Each FacilityModel will define its own set of parameters that 
govern its performance.  The same FacilityModel may be used for 
multiple facility configurations in the same region, each with 
parameter values appropriate for that facility configuration.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Material movement is the primary unit of information in \Cyclus.  
Discrete materials passed, traded, and modified between and within facilities 
in the simulation are recorded at every timestep.  This material 
history is stored in the output dataset of \Cyclus. In addition to 
holding the map of isotopes and their masses, a material object holds 
a comprehensive history of its own path as it moves through models 
within the simulation. 

\subsection{Implications for \Cyder}

The above sections outline the fuel cycle simulation platform
currently under development at \gls{UW} in which the \Cyder repository model
at hand is implemented.  Implemented as a facility within this 
framework, the repository model interface is defined by the Facility
Model interface defined within the \Cyclus paradigm. Though some Facility 
models make both requests and offers to the system, the \Cyder model is a type 
of sink, making only requests as in Figure \ref{fig:sinkfacility}.

\begin{figure}[htb!]
  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{./chapters/paradigm/sinkfacility.eps}
  \end{center}
  \caption[\Cyder request-only interface.]{\Cyder is a type of \Cyclus FacilityModel that makes only requests 
  ($1\cdots N$).}
  \label{fig:sinkfacility}
\end{figure}

That interface requires that a capacity be defined by the repository at every 
\Cyclus timestep so that the repository may make appropriate requests of 
disposable material.

Furthermore, the capability for dynamic module loading possible within 
the \Cyclus paradigm allows the repository system subcomponents to be 
interchangeably loaded at runtime, enabling comparison of various 
repository subcomponents, physical models of varying levels of detail. 

The \Cyder repository is a subclass of the FacilityModel class.  That is, the 
repository inherits data, parameters and behaviors from the \Cyclus simulation 
FacilityModel class. \Cyder is distinguished from other FacilityModels used in 
\Cyclus when it overrides and supplements these behaviors and data with its own 
functionality and the functionality of its subcomponents.
