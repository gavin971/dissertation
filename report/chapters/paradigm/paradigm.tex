\chapter{Modeling Paradigm}\label{ch:paradigm}

The modeling paradigms of the \Cyclus simulation platform and the \Cyder 
disposal system simulator are described here. Design decisions emphasizing 
modularity in both tools and the interface between \Cyclus and \Cyder are 
discussed. The interfaces defining components of the \Cyder disposal system 
model follow.
