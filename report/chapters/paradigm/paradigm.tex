\chapter{Modeling Paradigm}\label{ch:paradigm}

The modeling paradigms of the Cyclus simulation platform and the \Cyder 
repository model are described here. Implications of the 
simulation platform architecture on the design of the repository model 
are discussed and the interfaces defining components of the repository 
model follow.
