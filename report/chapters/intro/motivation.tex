% Provide a brief description of the importance of the work (what problem it 
%   addresses/solves):

The development of sustainable nuclear fuel cycles is a key challenge as the 
use of nuclear power expands domestically and internationally.  Accordingly, 
the United States and other nations are considering a number of nuclear fuel 
cycle and geologic disposal options simultaneously \cite{doe_strategy_2013, 
von_lensa_red-impact_2008}.  These decisions 
are technologically coupled by repository capacity. That is, 
radionuclide containment performance of a geologic repository is, in part, a function of 
spent fuel and high level waste composition, which varies among fuel cycle 
options. For this reason, integration of a generic disposal model and a fuel 
cycle systems analysis framework is necessary to illuminate performance 
distinctions of candidate repository host media, designs, and engineering 
components in the context of fuel cycle options.  In answer to this need, \Cyder 
integrates with the \Cyclus computational fuel cycle systems analysis platform 
\cite{huff_cyder_2013,wilson_cyclus:_2012}. 


% The approach must also be modular to support combinatorially complex 
% decision space 

To support analysis of numerous combinatoric fuel cycle possibilities, a 
top-level simulation tool capable of modular substitution of various fuel cycle 
facility, repository, and engineered barrier components is needed. The 
modularity of natural and engineered barrier representations resulting from this 
work will assist in informing an array of current technology choices, 
identifying important coupled parameters contributing to key waste disposal 
metrics, and highlighting the most promising waste disposal combinations with 
respect to metrics chosen by the user. 

% Speed

System level fuel cycle simulation tools must facilitate efficient sensitivity 
and uncertainty analyses and simulation of a wide range of fuel cycle 
alternatives. Therefore, a generic repository model appropriate for systems 
analysis must emphasize speed in accordance with use cases requiring repeated 
simulations. Simultaneously, it must provide modeling options at a level of 
detail that successfully captures significant aspects of the underlying 
physics.  Often termed abstraction, the process of simplifying calculations while 
maintaining the salient features of the underlying physics 
was used to develop thermal and radionuclide transport models in this work. 

% The fuel cycle parameters that may be varied are numerous and coupled to the 
% back end.

Parameters of particular interest in fuel cycle systems analysis have 
historically been those related to the front end of the fuel cycle.  However, 
parameters representing decisions concerning the back end of the fuel cycle are 
of increasing interest as repositories are being considered internationally and 
as the United States further investigates repository alternatives to the 
\gls{YMR}.  Choices such as geologic media, engineered barriers, 
appropriate loading strategies and schedules are all independent parameters up 
for debate. Due to the coupled nature of repository capacity and 
performance, these parameters are coupled with decisions about the fuel cycle. 

% So we need a full systems analysis package, incorporating a repository. 

Thus, coupled parameters require full synthesis with a systems analysis code 
that dynamically and appropriately determines the isotopic mass flows into the 
repository, their appropriate conditioning, densities, and other physical 
properties.
