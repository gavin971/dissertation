\chapter{Summary and Proposed Work}\label{ch:future}

\section{Summary}

The need for this work has been shown by a summary of the current state of the 
art of fuel cycle simulator repository capabilities. The literature review 
concluded that most fuel cycle simulators lack repository analysis beyond basic 
mass tracking. The integrated radionuclide transport and thermal analysis to be 
pursued in this work will provide a currently unavailable tool for disposal 
system analysis. An immediate need for such a tool has been expressed in the 
\gls{UFD} campaign roadmap for this year in which an interface with the \gls{FCO} 
campaign was noted as a primary goal. 

\section{Proposed Work}

A disposal system simulator, integrated in the \Cyclus fuel cycle simulation platform, 
will be developed in three phases in parallel will supportive \Cyclus 
development. A demonstration phase will implement an `empty' repository 
structure which captures the fundamental software behavior of the subcomponents 
and integrated disposal system simulator. A base case phase will build upon the 
demonstration model by implementing the fundamental physics to represent key heat 
and radionuclide transport phenomena for simple unfractured media and canonical  
subcomponent concepts. The final extension phase will build upon the base case 
by implementing extending physics to capture the salient features of various 
competing repository concepts such as fracturing, sorption, and coalescent 
behavior. These phases will be completed within a test-driven software 
development paradigm and will rely on abstractions of the \gls{UFD} \gls{GDSM} 
and \gls{SINDAG} and \gls{LLNL} thermal models.  

\subsection{\Cyclus Framework}

Development of the \Cyclus fuel cycle simulator has generated a tool with which 
the systems analysis aspects of this work will be conducted. Development of the  
fundamental repository module concept appropriate for modular integration with 
\Cyclus has laid the foundation for a software effort which will deliver a 
library of disposal system component models capable of analyzing current 
disposal concepts of interest both domestically and internationally.

\subsection{Demonstration Case Development}

% Demonstration case milestone

A first milestone in the development of this software will be a  proof of 
principle demonstration of the data structure and information passing schemes.  
That is, no physics will be implemented in the demonstration milestone. Rather, 
the component models will be developed in such a way that they are capable of 
passing physically arbitrary thermal and solute fluxes to neighboring 
components and  placeholder functions will be implemented in place of physics.

\subsubsection{Demonstration Case Concept}

  % Concept

    % Facility Interface, complete

    % Control Volumes

    % Dynamic loading

  The demonstration will produce a complete but `empty' disposal system simulator. That 
  is, the appropriate facility interface will be implemented on the repository 
  scale, which allows the repository simulator to be loaded into a \Cyclus 
  simulation. A structure of subcomponent control volumes will also be 
  implemented which can be dynamically loaded at runtime.

    % Heat Information Passing

    % Nuclide Information Passing

    % Database writing, structure

  At the subcomponent level, the demonstration will include information passing,
  bookkeeping, and mass and energy balances within and between the subcomponent 
  control volumes.  Information passing between subcomponents concerning heat 
  and radionuclide concentration boundary conditions will be implemented. A 
  complementary output database structure will be defined and bookeeping for 
  writing relevant radionuclide and heat transport information.  

    % basic mass conservation checking

    % basic energy conservation checking


Volumes are defined by their dimensions, surfaces, temperature, contained
matter, and contained contaminants.  Interfaces are defined by a shared 
surface area, a flux type, and a flux direction. Any single volume may only 
interface with one inner and one outer volume. Contained matter must sum 
to the full volume of the control cell, in keeping with mass conservation.

This model treats matter in solid and liquid phases. Gaseous matter is not 
supported. 
Solids are assumed to be porous media and are defined by their porosity 
($n$, $\%$), tortuosity ($\tau$, $[-]$), and dry (bulk) density ($\rho$). 
Early phases of this work will assume just one liquid, water. Later 
extensions will incorporate varying water salinities and chemistries. 
In order to do so, liquids will be defined by their dynamic viscosities ($\mu$, 
[Pascal seconds]), characteristic diffusivities ($d_i$, $[m^2/s]$) and 
solubility ($K$,$[kg/m^3]$) coefficients for each nuclide.

\subsubsection{Demonstration Code Development}

  % Code Development
    
  Initial code development on the base case model has begun with creation of the 
  FacilityModel subclass, GenericRepository. This subclass meets the 
  requirements defined by the \Cyclus FacilityModel interface and can be 
  dynamically loaded by the simulator. 

  A first phase in the demonstration milestone will be for the disposal system simulator 
  to successfully load its subcomponent models from user input (i.e. the 
  waste form, waste package, buffer, and geology) with their corresponding 
  defining parameters. A set of parameters that may be sufficient to model the 
  base case is listed in Table \ref{tab:params}.

  \input{./chapters/future/params_tab.tex}

  A second phase will involve implementing an information exchange paradigm 
  between the subcomponents. The purpose of this information passing scheme will  
  be to communicate sufficient temperature fluxes and contaminant concentrations 
  at the boundaries of the control volumes for neighboring subcomponents to  solve 
  their internal transport calculations.  In addition to these Neumann type 
  boundary conditions, additional types of boundary conditions may need to be 
  anticipated.

  When these aspects are implemented, a structure for the output database will 
  be defined and appropriate bookkeeping  will be implemented sufficient to 
  communicate the heat and solute transport evolution within the repository. 

\subsubsection{Demonstration Testing}

  % Testing

  This work will be developed with a test driven development strategy. That is, 
  before any new functionality is implemented, a suite of tests is written which 
  as closely define its necessary behavior as possible. The software is then 
  written with the goal of passing the test suite. In this way, the software 
  developed in this work is expected to be comprehensively tested in parallel 
  with its development. 


    % Send through 1 radionuclide with no filters in the volumes

    % Have each control volume release 1/3 of what it accepts. see 1/81st.

    Test problems which will help comprehensively define and confirm each unit 
    of the  demonstration functionality will include very basic information 
    passing tests as well as more complex multiple subcomponent integration 
    tests. Every unit of functionality within the model should be tested as an 
    integral part of development.

    A null test of the demonstration case, for example, will release a single 
    contaminant radionuclide through each subcomponent sequentially. This test 
    will pass if  the bookkeeper properly writes to the database its 
    (aphysically unhindered) path through each control volume. Other tests might 
    include a set of database writing tests, subcomponent loading tests, and tests 
    of the facility interface.
    
    When these unit tests pass, validation efforts will take place which show 
    that the complete model behaves in agreement with the more detailed model 
    on which it was based. If it does not behave as expected, sensitivity 
    analyses, model abstraction, and computational development will be iterated 
    through until the model is validated. 


\subsection{Base Case Development}

% Base Case Milestone

The next phase in this work will be the development of the base case.  This 
will build upon the demonstration repository module by implementing fundamental
physics for each of the subcomponents.  This will include mass and thermal 
conservation balances in each control volume, mixing models that include 
dissolution and solubility limitations as well as fundamental heat transport
models within each subcomponent. These component models will be created using a 
dominant physics based approach that emphasizes the most important physics 
affecting radionuclide transport in each component. This milestone will result 
in a repository module capable of modeling the clay and salt \gls{GDSM} concept 
modeled by the \gls{UFD} campaign and the \gls{ANDRA} and RED-IMPACT  assessments.
This step will implement the calculations in each subcomponent which 
will provide sufficient information to determine the heat based capacity of 
the repository for each request of material. 

\subsubsection{Base Case Component Abstraction}

% The physics of each component will first be filled in by simplistic models

To fill in thermal and solute transport physics models for each component, it 
will be necessary to begin with a few fundamental models for each component. 
That is, it is possible to model each component (i.e. waste form, waste package, 
buffer, and geology) in a simplistic way as well as a complex way. Table 
\ref{tab:cat} categorizes some potential models for each component. The detail 
with which these models calculate thermal and radionuclide transport will be 
determined by component level abstraction against the \gls{GDSM} models, the 
\gls{ANL} \gls{SINDAG} model, and the \gls{LLNL} heat model.

% Details will be added and subtracted by comparison with the detailed code

  \input{./chapters/future/cat_table.tex}

% On the component level, give examples.

On the component level, the importance of input parameters on outgoing fluxes 
will be analyzed using abstraction. For example, the relationship of the 
dimensions  of the waste package with the outgoing thermal flux 
will be analyzed by varying the waste package dimensions in the \gls{LLNL} 
model and observing its calculation of the thermal evolution of the boundary 
between the waste package and buffer \gls{EBS} components.

\subsubsection{Base Case System Level Abstraction}

% The physics of the system will be analyzed with relation to the models chosen

In addition to abstraction on the component level, the collective behavior of 
the system will be analyzed via abstraction as well. That is, the
appropriateness of model choices for each component and the behavior of 
combinations of collections of choices will be compared to results obtained from 
the detailed models. 

% Give an example on the system level of how this would work. 

For example, when enough buffer component models have been developed to give a 
suite of buffer options, the choice between a model that incorporates
fracturing in the degraded buffer material and one that does not incorporate 
fracturing may be available.  The choice between models will be informed by an 
analysis comparing results of each simulation and a similar full simulation with  
the detailed model.

% The importance of detail at the system level will be related to 

This type of system level abstraction analysis will be performed with each 
component for which a range of models exist. This analysis will seek out models 
which capture differences in ultimate repository releases and other repository 
performance metrics, but neglect detailed calculations which have negligible effects
on repository performance.

% In addition to abstraction, system level benchmarking must occur.

In conjunction with abstraction, system level benchmarking against the \gls{GDSM}, 
\gls{LLNL}, and \gls{ANL} \gls{SINDAG} models will be undertaken at this point for 
assurance that the representation of a canonical repository concept within this  
model has expected results. Benchmarking will confirm behavior at many levels, 
ensuring detailed release and heat evolution for known incoming waste streams
and repository configurations as well as ensuring trends in behavior for 
varied model parameters.

% Here is an example of system level sensitivity\ldots

Much of this phase of the work will emulate the parametric and regression analysis that
has begun with the base case Clay \gls{GDSM} at \gls{ANL}.  
The \gls{UFD} campaign has reported sensitivity results for various 
parameters as they affect Peak Annual Dose. These preliminary analyses have focused on 
general trends and coefficients defining the relationships between these 
parameters and source term over time for each isotope. 

For example, the vertical distance to the aquifer above the disposal configuration
defines the distance separating source term nuclide contaminants from the biosphere. 
The clay model indicates that the mean annual dose is very sensitive to this 
distance \cite{clayton_generic_2011}.

\begin{figure}[h!]
  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[height=7cm]{./chapters/future/overlyingDist.eps}
  \end{center}
  \caption[Distance to Aquifer Peak Dose Sensitivity]{An analysis by the UFD campaign with the clay GDSM shows that 
  the peak annual dose is very sensitive to the distance to the overlying 
  aquifer\cite{clayton_generic_2011}.}
  \label{fig:overlyingDist}
\end{figure}
\clearpage

Sensitivity to vertical Darcy flux is similar to the sensitivity to vertical 
distance to aquifer in the sense that it directly determines the nuclide travel 
time to the biosphere. The clay model indicates that the mean annual dose is 
very sensitive to this parameter as well \cite{clayton_generic_2011}. Other 
parameters such as the dimensions of the intersecting fast pathway, the 
permeable porous medium porosity, the waste form and waste package degradation 
rates, will be investigated with the \gls{GDSM} models, the \gls{SINDAG} model, 
and the \gls{LLNL} model. 

\subsubsection{Base Case Concept}

  % Concept

    % uniform unfractured permeable porous medium

      % reducing geochemistry

      The base case concept will model a generic, isotropic, permeable porous 
      geologic medium with reducing geochemistry, as well as waste form, 
      waste package, and buffer models in the near field. This model will be 
      appropriate for clay and salt geologic settings. The fracturing in the 
      granite and deep borehole concepts will not be 
      appropriately modeled in the base case unless an equivalent porous medium 
      calculation is conducted external to the code. The incorporation of 
      fracture models will follow in subsequent extensions to the base case.  

    % WP : steel

      % fractional
      
      An explicit time dependent probability distribution waste package failure 
      model will be employed that can accommodate instantaneous, constant, and 
      more complex time dependent failure probability density functions.
      From a user-defined time dependent probability distribution (of which the 
      Weibull distribution might be one), a waste package failure vector will be 
      populated, which assigns a failure time to each waste package object. As 
      the simulation progresses, these waste packages will fail discretely, 
      triggering the initial degradation attack for the waste forms within them. 
      The primary purpose of the waste package model, from a modeling 
      perspective, is to initiate the beginning of waste form dissolution.

    % Buffer : Purely Diffusive Transport 
      
      % permeable porous medium

      The buffer component will be modeled as an isotropic permeable porous 
      medium that is chemically reducing and in which transport is diffusion 
      dominated  and solubility limited.  For the base case, this model will 
      involve only diffusive transport. Extensions to this model will include a 
      model for sorption as well as fracturing and advective transport.  

    % Heat limits at buffer and rock boundary 

      Heat limits in the base case will be calculated at the boundary between 
      the waste package and buffer as well as the boundary between the buffer or  
      backfill and the rock matrix.




 
  
\subsubsection{Base Case Testing, Verification, and Validation}

  % Testing
   
  % verification / validation 

  For verification and validation during development, some comparisons to current 
  detailed models such as the \gls{UFD} \gls{GPAM} and GDSMs will be 
  incorporated into the testing framework. Additional verification and 
  validation can be expected to be conducted with respect to known benchmarks 
  such as \gls{ANDRA} and RED-IMPACT results once the model is fully functional.


\subsection{Extensions}

%  Extension Milestone

When the base case is established, a series of extensions to these models will 
be pursued.  This will build upon the base case repository module by 
incorporating sorption, fracturing, coalescence, and disruption 
models within each subcomponent.  This milestone will result in a repository 
module capable of modeling the granite and borehole \gls{GDSM} concepts modeled 
by the \gls{UFD} campaign and the \gls{ANDRA} assessments. Additional extension 
will also incorporate potentially important physical models of salt and clay
coalescent behaviors. 

Similar abstraction analysis will be undertaken for the phenomena involved in 
the extension models.  Detailed physics in the extension concepts will be
analyzed for their importance by regression analysis with the \gls{GDSM} 
tools and iteratively compared to analytical models.

The code development in the extension phase will follow the same pattern as 
previous phases, but will focus on extending just one physics model in each 
component at a time in order to gauge the component level and system level 
impacts.

\subsubsection{Extension Concepts}

  % Concepts

    % Sorption and fractures
    
    First, additional phenomena in radionuclide transport will be added to the 
    modeling capability. Sorption, for example, will be added by incorporating 
    sorption effects to the basic diffusive solute transport model, approaching  
    a full solute transport solution such as equation \eqref{ogatabanks}. 
    Additionally, solubility limited transport will be added with a simple 
    restriction on the mixing calculations during mass balancing in the control 
    volumes. Next, the capability to model fracture features of granite and
    borehole environments will be added  to the modeling capability by adding a dual 
    continuum fracture model.  

    % Coalescent behavior (salt and clay)

    Another anticipated extension will adapt the radionuclide transport model 
    to incorporate the effects of heat and time driven coalescent behavior in 
    clay and salt behavior. This extension will focus on the porosity decrease 
    in those media as time and heat drive collapse around the waste packages.  
    Time dependent coalescence will be addressed first, followed by temperature  
    dependent coalescence.

    % Fast Pathways (borehole and salt)

    A final potential extension may be implemented that will address the issue of 
    modeling a disruption scenario with a fast advective pathway that intersects 
    the repository.  A fast pathway model intended to demonstrate a disrupted 
    scenario is modeled as a single intersecting fracture in the clay matrix. 



  \subsubsection{Extension Testing, Verification, and Validation}

  % Testing

  Unit testing, verification and validation will occur in a manner very similar 
  to the previous milestones. Unit tests will assess the performance of each 
  extension functionality as well as their integrated behavior. Validation 
  against \gls{GDSM} results will also be performed for confidence building.

\subsection{Fuel Cycle Analysis}

As the model becomes capable of representing various repository concepts, these will  
be analyzed with relation to canonical closed, open, and modified fuel cycles as  
\Cyclus is capable of them. As discussed before, these fuel cycles will present 
different repository challenges, and analysis with an integrated repository 
model is expected to demonstrate the dynamics of these challenges. While it is 
out of the scope of this work to perform comprehensive analysis of fuel cycle 
options, this work seeks to provide a tool with which to perform such analyses. 
Thus, some limited analysis of fuel cycle options will be performed to demonstrate 
that the tools developed in this work can illustrate the sensitivity of repository 
performance to upstream fuel cycle options.


% UFD developing metrics for the fct program option screening these and perhaps 
% other metrics will be included.
