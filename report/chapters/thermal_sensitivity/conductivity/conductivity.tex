\section{Thermal Conductivity Sensitivity Study}\label{sec:conductivity}
The thermal conductivity, $K_{th}$ of geologic repository host media impacts 
the speed of transport, and therefore the time evolution of thermal energy 
deposition, in the medium. 

In the creation of the \gls{STC} database, the thermal conductivity was varied 
across a broad domain for each isotope, $i$, package spacing, $s$, limiting 
radius $r_{calc}$, and thermal diffusivity $\alpha_{th}$, considered.  By 
varying the thermal conductivity of the repository model from 0.1 to 4.5
$[W\cdot m^{-1} \cdot K^{-1}]$, this sensitivity analysis succeeds in capturing the domain of 
thermal conductivities witnessed in high thermal conductivity salt deposits as 
well as low thermal conductivity clays.
