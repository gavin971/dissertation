\chapter{GDSE Sensitivity Studies}\label{ch:sensitivity}

The modeling paradigm with which this repository model and simulation 
platform are implemented are described here. 
Sensitivity studies performed with the \gls{GDSM} tools developed within
the national lab system are here described. The results were analyzed to 
capture the salient parameters of readionuclide sequestration in 
various repository geologies.
