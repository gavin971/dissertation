Each engineered barrier component within the \Cyder disposal system simulator 
relies on a radionuclide mass balance model selected from the four presented in 
this chapter.  The dominant physics of mass transfer between components is 
selected from a set of mass transfer modes representing forced, advective, 
diffusive, and coupled flow.  In order to be interchangeable within the 
simulation, the radionuclide mass balance models have boundary interfaces 
designed to support the array of available mass transfer modes. 

Mass balance calculations range from simplistic rate based degradation model to 
a semi-analytic one dimensional solution to the advection dispersion equation.  
Mass transfer modes also range in complexity, including a fictionally 
simplistic forced transfer mode mode as well as modes capturing advection 
dominated, diffusion dominated, and coupled flow, respectively.


Thermal calculations are undertaken using a specific temperature change model.
