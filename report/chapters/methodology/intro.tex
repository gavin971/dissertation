Each engineered barrier component within the \Cyder disposal system simulator 
relies on a mass balance model, a mass transfer model, and a thermal model 
selected from those four presented in this chapter. 

Mass balance calculations range from simplistic rate based models to more 
detailed solutions capturing the physics of advection, dispersion, sorption, 
and solubility.  Mass transfer modes also range in complexity, including a 
fictionally simplistic forced transfer mode mode as well as modes capturing 
advection dominated, diffusion dominated, and coupled flow, respectively.  In 
order to be interchangeable within the simulation, the radionuclide mass 
balance models have boundary interfaces designed to support the array of 
available mass transfer modes. 

Thermal calculations are undertaken using a specific temperature change model 
based on a thermal response database populated sufficiently to support thermal 
transport in clay, granite, and salt. This database captures the effect of 
thermal diffusivity, thermal conductivity, and varying waste isotopics.
