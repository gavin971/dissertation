\subsubsection{Dispersion Dominated Mass Transfer}\label{sec:diff_mass_transfer}


The second type, specified-flow or Neumann type boundary conditions describe a full set of 
concentration gradients at the boundary of the domain,
    \begin{align}
      \frac{\partial C(\vec{r},t)}{\partial r}\Big|_{\vec{r}\in\Gamma} &= f(t)\\
      f(t) &= \mbox{ known function }.\nonumber
    \end{align}

The Neumann boundary condition can be provided at the external boundary of any 
mass balance model,
\begin{align}
\frac{\partial C}{\partial z}\Bigg|_{z=r_j} &= \mbox{ fixed concentration gradient in j at }r_j\mbox{ and } t_n [kg/m^3/s].\nonumber
\end{align}


For mass balance models that are 0d in space (i.e. the Degradation Rate model 
and the Mixed Cell model), the center-to-center difference between adjacent 
components is taken,

\begin{align}
\frac{\partial C(z,t_n)}{\partial z}\Bigg|_{z=r_j} &= \frac{C_k(r_{k-1/2},t_{n-1}) - C_j(r_{j-1/2}, t_n)}{r_{k-1/2} - r_{j-1/2}}
\intertext{where}
r_{j-1/2} &= r_{j} - \frac{r_{j} - r_i}{2}\nonumber\\
r_{k-1/2} &= r_{k} - \frac{r_{k} - r_j}{2}.\nonumber
\end{align}

However, for mass balance models that are 1d in space (i.e. the Lumped Parameter model 
and the One Dimensional PPM model), the derivative is taken based on the 
concentration profile in the internal component as it approaches the boundary. 
For the lumped parameter model, where the profile is assumed to be a linear 
relationship between $C_{in}$ and $C_{out}$, the gradient is

\begin{align} 
\frac{\partial C(z,t_n)}{\partial z}\Bigg|_{z=r_j} &= \frac{C_{out} - C_{in}}{r_{j} - r_{i}}.
\end{align}

For the one dimensional permeable porous medium model, the analytical 
derivative of equation \eqref{simple_genuchten} is evaluated at $r_j$.

In the Degradation Rate and Mixed Cell models, the Neumann boundary condition 
can be chosen to enforce a dispersive flux on the inner boundary. This choice 
is appropriate when the user expects a primarily dispersive flow across the 
boundary.
The dispersive flux in one dimension, 
\begin{align}
      J_{dis} &= \mbox{ Total Dispersive Mass Flux }[kg/m^2/s]\nonumber\\
      &= -\theta D\frac{\partial C}{\partial z}\Big|_{z=r_j} \nonumber
\end{align}
relies on the fixed gradient Neumann boundary condition at the interface, 
provided by the internal component. 

The resulting mass transfer into the Degradation Rate or Mixed Cell model is, 
therefore, 

\begin{align}
m_{ij}(t_n) &= - A\Delta t D \frac{\partial C(z,t_n)}{\partial z}|_{z=r_i}.
\end{align}
