\subsubsection{Implicit Mass Transfer}

On its inner boundary, the Lumped Parameter model uses the fixed concentration  
Dirichlet boundary condition directly in its solution such that, 
\begin{align}
C_{in,j}(t_n) &= C(z, t_n)|_{z=r_i}.
\end{align}

The resulting mass transfer into the external component containing the Lumped 
Parameter model is calculated by taking the integral of that concentration 
profile over the volume, 

\begin{align}
m_{ij}(t_n) &=\int C(z,t_n)dV - \int C(z, t_{n-1})dV.
\end{align}


In the case of the One Dimensional Permeable Porous Medium Model, 
the Dirichlet boundary condition at the boundary is similarly used directly in 
the solution as $C_0$ such that,

\begin{align}
  C_{0,j}(t_n) &= C(z, t_n)|_{z=r_i}.
\end{align}

The mass transfer on the inner boundary is similarly calculated by taking an 
integral of that profile over the volume,

\begin{align}
m_{ij}(t_n) &=\int C(z,t_n)dV - \int C(z, t_{n-1})dV.
\end{align}
