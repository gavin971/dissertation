The mass transfer interfaces between the mass balance models are essential to 
the understanding of the \Cyder paradigm.  

In groundwater transport, contaminants are transported by dispersion and 
advection. It is customary to define the combination of molecular diffusion and 
mechanical mixing as the dispersion tensor, $D$, such that, for a conservative 
solute (infinitely soluble and non-sorbing), the mass conservation equation 
becomes \cite{schwartz_fundamentals_2004, wang_introduction_1982, 
van_genuchten_analytical_1982}:

     \begin{align}
      J &= J_{dis} + J_{adv}\nonumber
      \intertext{where}
      J_{dis} &= \mbox{ Total Dispersive Mass Flux }[kg/m^2/s]\nonumber\\
      &= -\theta(D_{mdis} + \tau D_m)\nabla C \nonumber\\ 
      &= -\theta D\nabla C \nonumber\\
      J_{adv} &= \mbox{ Advective Mass Flux }[kg/m^2/s]\nonumber\\
      &= \theta vC\nonumber\\
      \tau &= \mbox{ Tortuosity }[-] \nonumber\\
      \theta &= \mbox{ Porosity }[-] \nonumber\\
      D_m &= \mbox{ Molecular diffusion coefficient }[m^2/s]\nonumber\\
      D_{mdis} &= \mbox{ Coefficient of mechanical dispersivity}[m^2/s]\nonumber\\
      D &= \mbox{ Effective Dispersion Coefficient }[m^2/s]\nonumber\\
      C &= \mbox{ Concentration }[kg/m^3]\nonumber\\
      v &= \mbox{ Fluid Velocity in the medium }[m/s].\nonumber
    \end{align}

For uniform flow in $\hat{k}$, 
    \begin{align}
      J &=\left(-\theta D_{xx} \frac{\partial C}{\partial x}
             \right)\hat{\imath}
             + \left( -\theta D_{yy} \frac{\partial C}{\partial y}
            \right)\hat{\jmath}
            + \left( -\theta D_{zz} \frac{\partial C}{\partial z}
             + \theta v_zC 
            \right)\hat{k}.
      \label{unidirflow}
    \end{align}

Solutions to this equation can be categorized by their boundary conditions.  
Those boundary conditions serve as the interfaces between components in the 
\Cyder library of nuclide transport models by way of advective, dispersive, 
coupled, and fixed fluxes.  This is supported by implementation in which 
vertical advective velocity is uniform throughout the system and in which 
parameters such as the dispersion coefficient are known for each component.

  introduce 2 different mass transfer modes

  explicit: a model is chosen to represent the mass transfer and the sink 
  inventory is updated based on this transfer rate (I think these are only used 
  between a pair of 0-D models [KDH note: all components allow this on their 
  external boundary. Only the 0D models also allow this on their inner 
  boundary.]) introduce overall concept of combined advective and diffusive mass transfer

  implicit: a sink inventory is updated based on its distribution model, and 
  mass is transferred to accomplish the change in inventory
