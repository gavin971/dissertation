The mass balance models selected to represent the physics of mass distribution 
within each component are selected among four options. Two of these are 
zero-dimensional in space and two are one-dimensional in space. 

These models are differentiated from one another by the physics that they 
capture as well as the detail and accuracy with which they capture it. 
Depending on the user's available data, need for accuracy, and need for speed, 
some mass balance models will be more appropriate than others. 






Introduce Concepts of how mass can be distributed : 
- 0d models have a distributions between liquid and solid phase
- 1d models have a distribution over space (and time?)
