\subsubsection{Mixed Cell Radionuclide Mass Balance Model}\label{sec:mixed_cell}

Slightly more complex, the mixed cell model incorporates the influence of 
porosity, elemental solubility limits, and sorption in addition to the 
degradation behavior of the Degradation Rate model. A graphical representation 
of the mixed cell model is given in Figure \ref{fig:deg_sorb_volumes}.  
\input{./chapters/methodology/nuclide_models/mixed_cell/deg_sorb_volumes}

After some time degrading, the total volume in the degraded region can be 
expressed as in equation \eqref{deg_volumes}. Additionally, the intact and 
degraded volumes can also be described in terms of their constituent solid 
matrix and pore fluid volumes, 

\begin{align}
V_d(t_n) &= \mbox{ degraded volume at time }t_n [m^3]\nonumber\\
          &= V_{df}(t_n) + V_{ds}(t_n)
\intertext{where}
V_{df}(t_n) &= \mbox{ degraded fluid volume at time }t_n[m^3]\nonumber\\
       &= \theta V_d(t_n)\\
       &= \theta d(t_n) V_T
\end{align}
\begin{align}
V_{ds}(t_n) &= \mbox{ degraded solid volume at time }t_n [m^3]\nonumber\\
       &= (1-\theta) V_d(t_n)\\
       &= (1-\theta) d(t_n) V_T
\end{align}
\begin{align}
V_i(t_n) &= \mbox{ intact volume at time }t_n [m^3]\nonumber\\ 
       &= V_{if}(t_n) + V_{is}(t_n)
\end{align}
\begin{align}
V_{if}(t_n) &= \mbox{ intact fluid volume at time }t_n [m^3]\nonumber\\
       &= \theta V_i(t_n)\\
       &= \theta (1-d(t_n))V_T
\intertext{and}
V_{is}(t_n) &= \mbox{ intact solid volume at time }t_n [m^3]\nonumber\\
       &= (1-\theta) V_i(t_n)\\
       &= (1-\theta) (1-d(t_n))V_T.
\end{align}

This model distributes contaminant masses throughout each sub-volume of the 
component. Contaminant 
masses and concentrations can therefore be expressed with notation indicating 
in which volume they reside, such that

\begin{align}
C_{df} &= \frac{m_{df}}{V_{df}} \label{c_df}\\
C_{ds} &= \frac{m_{ds}}{V_{ds}} \label{c_ds}\\
C_{if} &= \frac{m_{if}}{V_{if}} \label{c_if}\\
C_{is} &= \frac{m_{is}}{V_{is}}.  \label{c_is}
\end{align}

The contaminant mass in the degraded fluid is the contaminant mass that is 
treated as `available' to adjacent components. 

\subsubsection{Sorption}

The mass in all volumes exists in both sorbed and non-sorbed phases. The 
relationship between the sorbed mass concentration in the solid phase (e.g. the 
pore walls), 

\begin{align}
s &=\frac{\mbox{ mass of sorbed contaminant} }{ \mbox{mass of total solid phase }}
\label{solid_conc}
\end{align}
and the dissolved liquid concentration, 
\begin{align}
c &=\frac{\mbox{ mass of dissolved contaminant} }{ \mbox{volume of total liquid phase }}
\label{liquid_conc}
\end{align}
can be characterized by a sorption `isotherm' model. A sorption isotherm 
describes the equilibrium relationship between the amount of material bound to 
surfaces and the amount of material in the solution. The MixedCell NuclideModel 
uses a linear isotherm model.

With the linear isotherm model, the mass of contaminant sorbed into the 
solid phase can be found 
\cite{schwartz_fundamentals_2004}, according to the relationship 
\begin{align}
s_{i} &= K_{di} c_{i}
\label{linear_iso}
\intertext{where}
s_i &= \mbox{ the solid concentration of isotope i }[kg/kg]\nonumber\\
K_{di} &= \mbox{ the distribution coefficient of isotope i}[m^3/kg]\nonumber\\
c_i &= \mbox{ the liquid concentration of isotope i }[kg/m^3].\nonumber
\end{align}

Thus, from \eqref{solid_conc},

\begin{align}
s_{dsi} &= K_{di} C_{dfi}\nonumber\\
         &= \frac{K_{di}m_{dfi}}{V_{df}}\nonumber
\intertext{where}
s_{dsi} &= \mbox{ isotope i concentration in degraded solids } [kg/kg] \nonumber\\
C_{dfi} &= \mbox{ isotope i concentration in degraded fluids } [kg/m^3]. \nonumber
\end{align}

In this model, sorption is taken into account throughout the volume. In the 
intact matrix, the contaminant mass is distributed between the pore walls and 
the pore fluid by sorption.  So too, contaminant mass released from the intact 
matrix by degradation is distributed between dissolved mass in the free fluid 
and sorbed mass in the degraded and precipitated solids.

To solve for the boundary conditions in this model, the amount of non-sorbed 
contaminant mass in the degraded fluid volume must be found. Dropping the 
isotope subscripts and beginning with equations \eqref{c_df} and \eqref{linear_iso},

\begin{align}
m_{df} &= \frac{C_{df}}{V_{df}} = \frac{m_{ds}V_{df}}{K_dV_{ds}}\nonumber
\intertext{and assuming the sorbate is in the degraded solids}
       &= \frac{V_{df}}{K_dV_{ds}}\left(dm_T - m_{df}\right),\nonumber
\intertext{this can be rearranged to give}
m_{df} &= \frac{dm_TV_{df}}{K_dV_{ds}}\frac{1}{\left( 1+ \frac{V_{df}}{K_dV_{ds}}\right)}.
\intertext{Finally, in terms of total volume,}
m_{df} &= \frac{d^2 m_T\theta V_T}{dK_d(1-\theta)V_T}\left( \frac{1}{1+\frac{\theta d V_T}{K_d(1-\theta)dV_T} }\right)\\  
       &= \frac{d m_T\theta }{K_d(1-\theta) + \theta}.
\end{align}

\subsubsection{Solubility}
Dissolution of the contaminant into the 
available fluid volume is constrained by the 
elemental solubility limit \cite{hedin_integrated_2002}, 
    \begin{align}
      m_{df,i} &\leq V_w C_{sol,i}
    \intertext{where}
      m_{df,i} &= \mbox{ solubility limited mass of isotope i in volume }V_{df} [kg]\nonumber\\ 
      C_{sol,i} &= \mbox{ the maximum dissolved concentration limit of i }[kg/m^3].\nonumber
    \end{align}
