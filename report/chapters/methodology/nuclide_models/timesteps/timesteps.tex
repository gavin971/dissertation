\subsection{Implicit Timestepping}\label{sec:timestepping}

4.1.1 timestep algorithm

presume/assume unidirectional flow from inside to outside, therefore:

start with interior flows and work outwards

at each mass transfer interface we desire to solve that flow model with most up-to-date information:

first solve the internal mass distribution model for the interior (source) volume

depending on the mass distribution model of the sink volume

if 0-D model

solve the explicit mass transfer model at the interface

update the mass inventory of the source and sink volumes


else

solve the mass distribution model for the sink volume

determine the implicit mass flux based on the updated sink parameters
