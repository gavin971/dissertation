The principal result of radionuclide contaminant transfer in \Cyder is an 
assessment of radionuclide contaminants that reach the far field. This 
calculation is a key piece of information for repository performance assesment 
metrics regarding containment.  

The \Cyder model addresses this performance assesment by modeling the various 
engineered and natural containment barriers as finite control volumes connected 
by mass transfer interfaces. These approximations of mass transfer are based on 
parameters derived from the inventory and distribution of mass within adjacent 
control volumes. Meanwhile, mass inventory is a simple sum of in and out flows, 
and mass distribution within the control volume is determined by the dominant 
physics of the mass balance model selected for that volume.
