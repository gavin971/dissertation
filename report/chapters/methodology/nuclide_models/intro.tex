\subsection{Mass Inventory and Distribution Models}\label{sec:mass_balance}
% 4.1. Mass Transport Modeling
% Overview of simulation paradigm (important to provide a concise overview of
% the building blocks so readers know how they fit together)

% principal result is mass of radionuclides in far field

% finite control volumes connected by mass transfer interfaces

% models for mass transfer interfaces give different approximations for mass
% transfer, based on parameters derived from the inventory and distribution of
% mass within adjacent control volumes

% mass inventory is a simple sum of in and out flows

% models for control volumes give different approximations for distribution of
% mass within the control volume
