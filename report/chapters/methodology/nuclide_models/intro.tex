Each engineered barrier component within the \Cyder disposal system simulator calculates 
radionuclide transport using a radionuclide transport model selected from the four presented in this 
chapter. In order to be interchangeable within the simulation, radionuclide 
transport models have identical boundary interfaces supporting an array of 
boundary condition specifications. 

Radionuclide transport models may rely on a number of boundary condition forms.  
Each radionuclide model interface therefore provides sufficient boundary condition 
information to support the calculation methods of all other radionuclide models. That 
is, each must provide a superset of the boundary condition forms required by all 
four models. In addition to a simplistic mass transfer source term boundary 
condition, these include Dirichlet, specified species concentration along the 
boundary, Neumann, concentration gradients along the boundary, Cauchy, a 
combination of the two that provides a concentration flux along the boundary.
