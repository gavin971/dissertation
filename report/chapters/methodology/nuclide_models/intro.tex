Each engineered barrier component within the \Cyder disposal system simulator 
calculates radionuclide transport using a radionuclide mass balance model 
selected from the four presented in this chapter. The dominant physics of mass 
transfer between components is also selected from a set of mass transfer modes 
representing forced, advective, diffusive, and coupled flow.
In order to be interchangeable within the simulation, radionuclide mass balance 
models have identical boundary interfaces supporting an array of mass transfer 
modes accross the boundaries.

Each component interface provides sufficient boundary condition information to 
support the calculation methods of all other radionuclide mass transport models. That 
is, each must provide a superset of the boundary condition forms required by all 
four models. In addition to a simplistic source term interface, other 
boundary forms include Dirichlet - specified species concentration along the 
boundary, Neumann - concentration gradients along the boundary, and Cauchy - 
specified concentration flux along the boundary.
