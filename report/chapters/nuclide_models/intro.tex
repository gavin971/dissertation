Each engineered barrier component within the Generic Repository calculates 
nuclide transport using a model selected from the four presented in this 
chapter. In order to be interchangeable within the simulation, these components 
have identical nuclide transport interfaces.  

Radionuclide transport models may rely on a number of boundary condition forms.  
Each nuclide model interface therefore provides sufficient boundary condition 
information to support the calculation methods of all other nuclide models. That 
is, each must provide a superset of the boundary condition forms required by all 
four models. These include Dirichlet, specified species concentration along the 
boundary, Neumann, concentration gradients along the boundary, and Cauchy, a 
combination of the two that provides a concentration flux along the boundary.
