\chapter{Introduction}
The scope of this work includes implementation of a comprehensive software library of
medium fidelity models to represent the thermal behavior and long-term disposal system
performance of different disposal system concepts in different geologic media for deployment in a 
modular systems analysis platform. This work will model repository behavior as a function of 
arbitrary spent fuel composition as well as modularly incorporate dominant physics process models 
into a computational fuel cycle analysis platform.
