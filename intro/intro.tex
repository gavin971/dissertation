\chapter{Introduction}\label{ch:introduction}
% The scope of the work includes software and analysis.

The scope of this work includes implementation of a comprehensive 
software library of medium fidelity models to represent the long-term 
disposal system performance of different disposal system concepts in 
various geologic media for deployment in a modular systems analysis 
platform.  This work will model repository behavior as a function of 
arbitrary spent fuel composition by modularly incorporating dominant 
physics disposal system models into a computational fuel cycle 
analysis platform.

\section{Motivation} 
% There needs to be a system level approach to repository analysis 
% which is both modular and efficient.

The development of sustainable nuclear fuel cycles is a key challenge 
as the use of nuclear power expands internationally. While fuel cycle 
performance may be measured with respect to a variety of metrics, 
waste management metrics are of particular importance to the goal of 
sustainability. Since disposal options are heavily dependent on 
upstream fuel cycle decisions, a relevant analysis of potential 
geological disposal and engineered barrier solutions therefore 
requires a system level approach that is both modular and efficient. 

% The approach must also be modular to support combinatiorically 
% complex decision space 
As the merits of numerous combinatoric fuel cycle possibilities are 
investigated, a top-level simulation tool which will allow modular 
substitution of various fuel cycle facility, repository, and 
engineered barrier component models is needed. The modular waste 
package and repository models resulting from this work will assist in 
informing current technology choices, identifying important parameters 
contributing to key waste disposal metrics, and highlighting the most 
promising waste disposal combinations. Specifically, such models will 
support efforts underway in the development of computational tools to 
quantify these metrics and understand the merits of different fuel 
cycle alternatives. 

% The modeling approach must be efficient in order for many scenarios 
% to be compared quickly
System level fuel cycle simulation tools must facilitate efficient 
simulation of a wide range of fuel cycle alternatives as well as 
sensitivity and uncertainty analyses. Efficiency is achieved with 
models at a level of detail which successfully captures significant 
aspects of the underlying physics while acheiving a calculation speed 
in accordance with use cases requiring repeated simulations. Often 
termed abstraction, the process of simplifying while maintaining the 
salient features of the underlying physics is the method by which used 
fuel disposal system models are developed in this work. 

\subsection{Future Fuel Cycle Options}
% DOE is interested in many fuel cycle options. 

Domestically, nuclear power expansion is motivated by the research, 
development, and demonstration roadmap being pursued by the United 
States Department of Energy Office of Nuclear Energy (DOE-NE) which 
seeks to ensure that nuclear energy remain a viable domestic energy 
option.  \cite{department_of_energy_-_nuclear_energy_nuclear_2010} 

% DOE is considering 3 main options, each of which pose different 
% waste management challenges . . .
As the DOE-NE seeks to develop technologies and strategies to support 
a sustainable future for nuclear energy, various fuel cycle strategies 
and corresponding disposal system options are being considered.  
Specifically, the domestic fuel cycle option space under current 
consideration is described in terms of three distinct fuel cycle 
categories with the monikers Once Through, Full Recycle, and Modified 
Open. Each category presenting unique disposal system siting and 
design challenges. Systems analyses for evaluating these options must 
be undertaken in order to inform a national decision to deploy a 
comprehensive fuel cycle system by 2050.  
\cite{department_of_energy_-_nuclear_energy_nuclear_2010} 

% Once through presents capacity issues . . . 
A Once-Through Cycle represents the continuation of the business as 
usual case in the United States, which neglects reprocessing, and 
presenting the challenges associated with high volumes of minimally 
treated spent fuel streams.  In a business as usual scenario, 
conventional power reactors comprise the majority of nuclear energy 
production and fuel takes a single pass through a reactor before it is 
classified as waste and disposed of. In the open cycle, no 
reprocessing is pursued, but research and development of advanced 
fuels seek to reduce waste volumes. Calculations from the Electric 
Power Research Institute indicate that such a cycle will generate a 
volume of spent fuel that will necessitate the siting of two or more 
federal  geological repositories to accomodate spent fuel.  
\cite{kessler_room_2006}  %% KDHFLAG WHEN? HOW LONG?

% Full Recycle presents the issue of variable waste streams. . .
A Full Recycle option, on the other hand, requires the research, 
development, and deployment of partititioning, transmutation, and 
advanced reactor technology for the reprocessing of used nuclear fuel.  
In this scheme, conventional once-through reactors will be phased out 
in favor of fast reactor and Gen-IV reactor technologies with 
transmutation capacity and greater fuel efficiency. All fuel in the 
Full Recycle strategy will be reprocessed. It may be reprocessed using  
an accelerator driven system or by cycling through an advanced fast 
reactor. Such fuel may undergo partitioning and waste treatment before 
ultimate disposal in a repository. Thus, a repository under the Full 
Recycle scenario must adaptively support highly variable waste stream 
composition, as well as myriad waste forms and packaging associated 
with isolation of differing waste streams.

% Modified Open presents both problems. . . 
Finally, the Modified Open Cycle category of options includes a 
variety of fuel cycle options that fall between once through and fully 
closed. Advanced fuel cycles such as deep burn and small modular 
reactors will be considered within the Modified Open set of fuel cycle 
options as will partial recycle options. Partitioning and reprocessing 
strategies, however, will be limited to simplified chemical 
separations and volitilization under this scheme. Spent fuel volumes 
and composition will vary dramatically among various possibilities 
within this scheme.  
\cite{department_of_energy_-_nuclear_energy_nuclear_2010} 

% Various waste streams require various WFs and WPs 
Clearly, the myriad waste streams resulting from potential fuel cycles 
present an array of corresponding waste disposition, packaging, and 
engineered barrier system options. A comprehensive analysis of the 
disposal system, dominant physics models must therefore be developed 
for these subcomponents.  Differing spent fuel composition, 
partitioning, transmutation, and chemical processing decisions 
upstream in the fuel cycle demand differing performance and loading 
requirements of waste forms and packaging. The capability to model 
thermal and nuclide transport phenomena through, for example, 
vitrified glass as well as ceramic waste forms with with various 
loadings for arbitrary isotopic compositions is therefore required.  

\subsection{Future Waste Disposal System Options}

% DOE is thinking about various geologies
In addition to reconsideration of the domestic fuel cycle policy, the 
uncertain future of the Yucca Mountain repository has driven the 
expansion of the option space of potential repository geologies to 
include, at the very least, granite, clay, shale, salt, and deep 
borehole concepts \cite{nutt_used_2010}. 

% Various waste forms, packages, etc. are being considered.
In accordance with various fuel cycle options, corresponding waste 
form, waste package, and other engineered barrier systems are being 
considered. Specifically, current considerations include ceramic (e.g.  
Uranium Oxide), glass (e.g.  borosilicate glasses), and metallic (e.g.  
hydride fuels) waste forms. Waste packages may be copper, steel, or 
other alloys. Similarly, buffer and backfill materials vary from the 
crushed salt recommended for a salt repository to bentonite concrete 
in other lithologies. % KDHFLAG this paragraph needs explication

% Various geologies, WFs, WPs, EBSs have various physics
The physical, hydrogeologic, and geochemical mechanisms which dictate 
nuclide and heat transport vary between the geological and engineered 
containment systems in the domestic option space.  Therefore, in 
support of the system level simulation effort, models must be 
developed which capture the salient physics of these geological 
options and quantify associated disposal metrics and benefits.  
Furthermore, modular linkage between subcomponent process modules and 
the repository envrionmental model must acheive a cohesively 
integrated disposal system model. 


\subsubsection{Thermal Modeling Needs}
% repository loading limits
% optimization of layout
% necessary decay cooling time before emplacement.
Heat limits within a used nuclear fuel disposal system are waste form, 
package, and geology dependent. Heat generation from the waste form 
and transport through the engineered barrier system and host 
environment constrains fuel loading in waste forms and packages as 
well as placing requirements on the size, design, and loading strategy 
in a potential geological repository.

Heat load limits of various waste forms have their technical basis in 
the temperature dependence of isolation integrity of the waste form.  
The waste form dissolution behavior under heat generation from the 
contained isotopics constrains loading density within the waste form 
in a nuclide specific way.  

Heat load limits of various engineered barrier systems similarly have 
a technical basis in the temperature dependent dissolution rate of the 
materials from whence they are constructed.  

Heat load limits of the geologic environment on the other hand are not  
based on the mechanical integrity of the rock.  Rather, the isolating 
characteristics of a geological environment are most sensitive to 
hydrologic and geochemical phenomena, so heat load contstraints are 
typically chosen to control hydrologic and geochemical response to 
thermal loading. In the United States, current regulations stipulate 
thermal limits in order to passively steward the repository's 
hydrologic and geochemical integrity against radionuclide  release for 
the upcoming 10,000 years.

The two heat load constraints which primarily determined the 
heat-based SNF capacity limit in the Yucca Mountain Repository design, 
for example, are fairly specific to unsaturated tuff. 

The first constraint intends to prevent repository flooding and 
subsequent contaminated water flow through the repository. It requires 
that the minimum temperature in the granite tuff between drifts be no 
more than the boiling temperature of water which, at the altitude in 
question, is $96^{\circ}C$. This is effectively a limit on the 
temperature halfway between adjacent drifts, where the temperature 
will be at a minimum.

The second constraint intends to prevent high rock temperatures that 
induce fractures and would increase leach rates. It states that no 
part of the rock reach a temperature above $200^{\circ}C$, and is 
effectively a limit on the temperature at the drift wall, where the 
rock temperature is a maximum.  

Analgous constraints for a broader set of possible geological 
environments will depend on heat transport parameters of the matrix, 
hydrogeologic state, and repository drift spacing, waste package 
spacing, and repository footprint among other parameters. 

\subsubsection{Radiotoxicity and Source Term Modeling Needs}

Domestically, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission has defined a limit on  
human exposure due to the repository. This regulation places important 
limitations on capacity, design, and loading techniques for repository 
concepts under consideration. Repository concepts developed in this 
work must therefore quantify nuclide transport through the geological 
environment in order to calculate repository capacity and other 
benefit metrics. 

The exposure limit set by the NRC is based on a `reasonably exposed 
individual.' That is to say, the limiting case is a person who lives, 
grows food, drinks water and breathes air 18 km downstream from the 
repository. The Yucca Mountain Repository legistlative regulations 
limit total dose from the repository to 15 mrem/yr, and limit dose 
from drinking water to 4 mrem/yr.  Predictions of that dose rate 
depend on an enormous variety of factors. The primary pathway of 
radionuclides from an accidental release will be from cracking aged 
canisters. Subsequently, transport of the radionuclides to the water 
table requires that the leakages come in contact with water and travel 
through the rock the water table. This results in contamination of 
drinking water downstream.  

Source term is a measure of the quantity of a radionuclide released 
into the environment whereas radiotoxicity is a measure of the 
hazardous effect of that particular radionuclide upon human ingestion.  
In particular, radiotoxicity is measured in terms of the volume of 
water dilution required to make it safe to ingest. Studies of source 
term and radiotoxicity therefore make probabilistic assessments of 
radionuclide release, transport, and human exposure.  The 
probabilistic nature of these assessments mean a direct dependence of 
source term on repository capacity can be difficult to arrive at. In 
order to give informative values for the risk associated with 
transport of particular radionuclides, for example, studies make 
hundred thousand year predictions about waste form degredation, water 
flow, etc.  

Importantly, due to the long time scale and intrinsic uncertainties 
required in probabilistic assessment it is in general not advisable to 
base any maximum repository capacity estimates on source term.  
However, source term is a useful metric for the comparison of 
alternative separations and fuel cycle scenarios.

A generalized metric of probablistic risk is fairly difficult to 
arrive at. For example, the Peak Environmental Impact metric (PEI) 
from Berkeley \cite{bouvier_comparison_2007} is a multifaceted 
function of spent fuel composition, waste conditioning, vitrification 
method, and radionuclide transport through the repository walls and 
rock.  Also, it makes the assumption that the waste canisters have 
been breached at $t=0$. Furthermore, reported in $m^3$, PEI is a 
measure of radiotoxicity in the environment in the event of total 
breach. While informative, this model on its own does not completely 
determine a source-term limited maximum repository capacity. 
Additional waste package failure and exposed individual radiotoxicity 
constraints must be incorporated into it.

\section{Methodology} 

% Scope
In this work, concise dominant physics models suitable for system 
level fuel cycle codes will be developed from comparison of analytical 
models with more detailed repository modeling efforts. The ultimate 
objective of this effort is to develop a software library capable of 
assessing a wide range of combinations of fuel cycle alternatives, 
potential waste forms, repository design concepts, and geological 
media. 

% Categorization
Categorization and characterization of phyisical mechanisms by which 
nuclide and thermal transport take place within the materials and 
media under consideration will first be undertaken. In this way, the 
domain of applicability for which subprocesses may be generalized will 
be assessed. In so doing, a preliminary set of combinations of fuel 
cycles, waste forms, repository designs, and geologies can be chosen 
which covers a foundational subspace of the parametric domain. Once 
complete, extended models and model variants will be developed to more 
comprehensively cover the option space.  

% Abstraction = Analytic Solutions + Regression Approximation
In general, such concise models are a combination of two components: 
semi-analytic mathematical models that represent a simplified 
description of the most important physical phenomena, and 
semi-empirical models that reproduce the results of detailed models.  
By shifting the emphasis between the complexity of the analytic models 
and regression against numerical experiments, variations can be 
limited between two models for the same system.  Different approaches 
will be compared in this work, with final modeling choices balancing 
the accuracy and efficiency of the possible implementations.  

% For example, Geology.
Specifically, geological models will focus on the hydrogeology and 
thermal physics dominating nuclide transport and heat response in 
candidate geologies as a function of nuclide release and heat 
generation over long time scales from waste packages.  Disposal site 
water chemistry (redox state) and dominant transport mechanism 
(advection or diffusion) will provide primary differentiation between 
the different geologic media under consideration. In addition, the 
concise models will be capable of roughly adjusting release pathways 
according to the characteristics of the natural system (both the host 
geology and the site in general) and the engineered system (such as 
package loading arrangements, tunnel spacing, and engineered 
barriers).

% Abstraction in repository environment
The abstraction process in the development of a geological environment 
model will employ the comparison of semi-analytic thermal and 
hydrogeologic models and analytic regression of rich code results as 
well as existing empirical geologic data.  

% Example, heat from WPs along repo drifts.
For example, analytic models and semi-empirical models are available 
(i.e. specific temperature integrals \cite{li_methodology_2006} or 
specific temperature change \cite{radel_effect_2007}) which 
approximate thermal response from heat generation in waste packages as 
linear along repository drifts. This analysis arrives at a thermal 
evolution over time at any location in the rock by superpositioning 
and integration. Subsequently, this result can be converted easily 
into conventional line loading and areal power density metrics.  Such 
analytic models will first be assessed to determine likely parameters 
upon which thermal response will rely (e.g. tunnel spacing, nuclide 
inventories, etc.).

% Regression.
Thereafter, a regression analysis concerning those parameters will be 
undertaken with available detailed models (e.g. 3D finite element 
codes and full performance assessment models) to further characterize 
the parametric dependence of thermal loading in a specific geology.  

% Incorporation of empirical data
Finally, the thermal behavior of a repository model so developed will 
depend on empirical data (e.g.  heat transfer coefficients, hydraulic 
conductivityetc.). Determination of appropriate values to make available 
within the dominant physics model will rely on existing empirical data 
concerning the specific geologic environment being modeled (i.e. clay, 
salt, shale, granite). A similar process will be followed for nuclide 
transport models.

% Abstraction for WFs, WPs, EBS, etc. will be the same
The abstraction process in the development of waste form, package, and 
engineered barrier system models will be analgous to the abstraction 
process of repository environment models. Concise models will result 
from employing the comparison of semi-analytic models of those systems 
with regression analysis of rich code in combination with existing 
empirical material data.

% Example, nuclide release
For instance, in the case of nuclide release from waste packages, 
analytic models of nuclide release (e.g.  congruent or solubility 
limited) will first be assessed to determine likely parameters upon 
which nuclide release will rely (e.g.  nuclide concentration, water 
flow rates, etc.) \cite{kawasaki_congruent_2004}.  Again, regression 
analysis concerning those parameters will be undertaken with available 
detailed models to further characterize the parametric dependence of 
nuclide release from specific waste packages.  Finally, the nuclide 
release model so developed will depend on empirical data (e.g. the 
waste package dissolution rate).  Determination of appropriate values 
to make available within the dominant physics model will rely on 
existing empirical data concerning the specific package materials 
being modeled (i.e.  extrapolations of known material failure rates).  

% Coupling is confusing
Coupling effects between components will have to be considered 
carefully.  In particular, given the important role of temperature in 
the system, thermal coupling between the models for the engineered 
system and the geologic system will be important. Thermal dependence 
of nuclide release and transport as well as package degradation will 
necessarily be analyzed to determine the magnitude of coupling effects 
in the system.


\section{Outline}

% Summarize document
The following chapter will present a literature review which organizes 
and reports upon previous relevant work. It will focus upon current 
analytical and computational modeling of nuclide and heat transport 
through various waste forms, engineered barrier systems, and 
geologies of interest. It will also address previous efforts in 
generic geology repository modeling and the state of the art of 
repository modeling and integration within current systems analysis 
tools. 

% modeling paradigm
Chapter \ref{ch:paradigm} will detail the computational paradigm with 
which the components within the repository system are modeled. Modules 
representing waste form, waste package, buffer, backfill, and 
engineered barier systems will be defined by their interfaces and 
their relationships as interconnected modules, distinctly defined, but 
coupled. This modular paradigm allows exchange  of technological 
options (i.e. borosilicate glass and concrete waste forms) for 
comparison but also exchange of equivalent models with varying levels 
of detail.

% Categorization of current codes and physics
Chapter \ref{ch:categorization} will categorize and characterize 
detailed computational models of nuclide and heat transport available 
for regression analysis. Specificially, detailed codes in current use 
are categorized according to the physics which they model, the 
disposal system components with which they are concerned, and the 
level of detail and computational methodology with which they capture 
physical phenomena. 

%
Chapter \ref{ch:repository} will detail the analytical and regression 
analysis undertaken to acheive a generic repository model for the 
chosen base repository type. A concise, dominant physics geological 
repository model of the base case disposal environment will be 
developed. Informed by semi-analytic mathematical models representing 
important physical phenomena, existing detailed computational efforts 
characterizing these repository environments will be appropriately 
simplified to create concise computational models. This abstraction 
will capture fundamental physics of thermal, hydrogeologic, and 
radionuclide transport phenomena while remaining sufficiently detailed 
to illuminate behavioral differences between each of the geologic 
systems under consideration.  Verification and validation of 
abstracted models will be conducted through iterative benchmarking 
against more detailed repository models.
