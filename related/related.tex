\chapter{Literature Review}
The following literature review addresses four areas of current research integral to the work at hand. First, a review of the contribution of computational nuclear fuel cycle simulation tools to sensitivity analyses of repository performance for various fuel cycles. A review of current computational repository models both standalone and those incorporated into nuclear fuel cycle simulation tools, follows. Special focus is paid to the availability and parametric regimes of supporting data and algorithms informing geochemical and hydrogeological transportmodels on long time scales. Finally, a gap analysis demonstrates the reange of available waste form performance models applicable to used fuel streams likely to result from various advanced fuel cycles.

\section{Geochemical Migration Models}
% Some mathematical models describing aqueous isotope transport in geologic settings are available absent of Engineered Barier Systems and the like. These solely model host rock transport. 
% Things to ask about each of them include:
% Which geologies do they model?
% How long do they take to run? 
% Are they proprietary? 
% How well validated are they?
\section{Repository Models}
% The total system performance assessment is one type. Repository modules incorporated into VISION and whatnot are another type. 
% Things to ask about each of them include:
% Which geologies do they model?
% How long do they take to run? 
% Are they proprietary? 
% How well validated are they?
\subsection{Stand Alone Models}
% TSPA - Think about Stephen L. Turner Document ( lessons learned ).
% TSPA for wipp?
% Sweden?
% France? 
% Figure out which repositories acutally exist in the world. There's certainly a repository for each.

\section{Waste Form Models}
\subsection{Borosilicate Glass}
% Current borosilicate glass: Includes processing chemicals from original separations, with U/Pu removed, but minor actinides and Cs/Sr remaining
% Potential borosilicate glass: No minor actinides and/or no Cs/Sr; Mo may be removed to increase glass loading of radionuclides; it has alower volumetric heat rate
\subsection{Glass Ceramic}
% Glass Ceramic:  This is glass-bonded sodalite from Echem processing of EBR-II, and from potential future Echem processing of oxide fuels o Metal Alloy: This includes subcategories
\subsection{Metal Alloy}
% Metal alloy from Echem: Includes cladding as well as noble metals that did not dissolve in the Echem dissolution
% Metal alloy from aqueous reprocessing:  Includes undissolved solids and transition metal fission products
\subsection{Advanced Ceramic}
% Advanced Ceramic: An advanced waste form that includes iodine volatilized during chopping, which is then gettered during head-end processing of used fuels
\subsection{Separated Streams}
% Other:  Examples include radionuclides removed from other waste forms (e.g., Cs/Sr, I, C), as well as new waste forms such as a salt waste form
\subsection{Classes A, B, and C waste}
% Lower Than High Level Waste (LTHLW): Includes Classes A, B, and C
\subsection{GTCC LTHLW}
% Greater Than Class C (GTCC)
