\section{Geochemical Migration Models}
% Some mathematical models describing aqueous isotope transport in geologic settings are available absent of Engineered Barier Systems and the like. These solely model host rock transport. 
% Things to ask about each of them include:
% Which geologies do they model?
% How long do they take to run? 
% Are they proprietary? 
% How well validated are they?
\section{Repository Models}
% The total system performance assessment is one type. Repository modules incorporated into VISION and whatnot are another type. 
% Things to ask about each of them include:
% Which geologies do they model?
% How long do they take to run? 
% Are they proprietary? 
% How well validated are they?
\subsection{Stand Alone Models}
% TSPA - Think about Stephen L. Turner Document ( lessons learned ).
% TSPA for wipp?
% Sweden?
% France? 
% Figure out which repositories acutally exist in the world. There's certainly a repository for each. 
\subsection{Models Incorporated into Systems Analysis Codes}
\section{Waste Form Models}
\subsection{Borosilicate Glass}
% Current borosilicate glass: Includes processing chemicals from original separations, with U/Pu removed, but minor actinides and Cs/Sr remaining
% Potential borosilicate glass: No minor actinides and/or no Cs/Sr; Mo may be removed to increase glass loading of radionuclides; it has alower volumetric heat rate
\subsection{Glass Ceramic}
% Glass Ceramic:  This is glass-bonded sodalite from Echem processing of EBR-II, and from potential future Echem processing of oxide fuels o Metal Alloy: This includes subcategories
\subsection{Metal Alloy}
% Metal alloy from Echem: Includes cladding as well as noble metals that did not dissolve in the Echem dissolution
% Metal alloy from aqueous reprocessing:  Includes undissolved solids and transition metal fission products
\subsection{Advanced Ceramic}
% Advanced Ceramic: An advanced waste form that includes iodine volatilized during chopping, which is then gettered during head-end processing of used fuels
\subsection{Separated Streams}
% Other:  Examples include radionuclides removed from other waste forms (e.g., Cs/Sr, I, C), as well as new waste forms such as a salt waste form
\subsection{Classes A, B, and C waste}
% Lower Than High Level Waste (LTHLW): Includes Classes A, B, and C
\subsection{GTCC LTHLW}
% Greater Than Class C (GTCC)
