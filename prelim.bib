	abstract = {The environmental impact of different fuel cycles based on Pressurized Water Reactor {(PWR)} and Fast Reactors {(FR)} has been assessed and compared. The study has been carried out by coupling two models: a waste conditioning model that determines the composition of the vitrified High Level Waste {(HLW)} and a radionuclide transport model that takes into account the release of radionuclide through the Engineered Barrier Systems {(EBS)} after failure of the canisters of a water-saturated repository. It follows from the study that the environmental impact per electricity generated of a {PWRMOX} system is substantially higher than the ones observed for {PWR-UO{sub} 2} and {FRs.} These differences are to be related to the waste conditioning constraints that determine the dilution of waste radionuclides within the borosilicate glass. A removal of the high heat emitting radionuclides such as Cm-244 is to that regard advisable. Numerical results show that the {PWR} cases studied here are more sensitive than {FR} systems to geologic repository characteristics such as the Canister Failure Time {(CFT).} For short {CFT}, this relatively high sensitivity is mainly due to Am-241.

	abstract = {Fuel cycle scenario analysis codes are valuable tools for investigating the effects of various decisions on the performance of the nuclear fuel cycle as a whole. Until recently, repository metrics in such codes were based on mass and were independent of the isotopic composition of the waste. A methodology has been developed for determining peak repository loading for an arbitrary set of isotopics based on the heat load restrictions and current geometry specifications for the Yucca Mountain repository. This model was implemented in the {VISION} fuel cycle scenario analysis code and is used here to study the effects of separation efficiencies on repository loading for various {AFCI} fuel cycle scenarios. Improved separations efficiencies are shown to have continuing technical benefit in fuel cycles that recycle Am and Cm, but a substantial benefit can be achieved with modest separation efficiencies.
