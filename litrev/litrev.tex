\chapter{Literature Review}\label{chap:litrev}
The following literature review addresses five areas of current research integral to the work at 
hand. The contribution of computational nuclear fuel cycle simulation tools to sensitivity analyses 
of repository performance metrics is first summarized. A review of current computational repository 
models follows, including both standalone and those incorporated into nuclear fuel cycle simulation 
tools. Special focus is paid to the availability of supporting data and algorithms informing 
geochemical and hydrogeological transport on long time scales and in various geologies. Next, an 
overview is presented of available waste form performance models, and finally, work is reviewed that 
concerns the need for simplified first order, physics based models of fuel cycle processes within 
the context of top level simulation.

\subsubsection{Fracturation}

% The distribution of fracture aperture sizes in a saturated fractured hard rock matrix determines the 
% appropriate model with which to treat rock fracturation and subsequent nuclide transport through 
% fracturous pathways. 

% Fracturation within a saturated medium can be treated either as an effective porosity, in which n_eff is suggested according 
% to the quantity of connected fractures, much like connected pores, in a rock matrix. If these are 
% of similar sizes, 

% Fracturation in grantite, tuff, and basalt have a log normal distribution of of fracture 
% apertures. Therefore, there are a few large fractures but the majority are microfractures. 
% Therefore, the equivalent porous medium approach is inappropriate. Instead we must take the 
% approach in which fractures of larger aperture are given greater importance and are modeled as primary 
% conduits to the biosphere while minor fractures can be considered a part of the porous medium of 
% the saturated rock. \cite{ahn_thesis}


% For details about fracturation models in unsaturated rock, it's likely best to consult YMR 
% TSPA models.

\paragraph{Sorption Into Matrix}

%Sorption into the rock matrix is a method by which contaminants (and water? ) are removed from a 
%fracture during flow through that fracture. However, this is a reversible process 
%\cite{ahn_thesis, pg 16}, which means the contaminant might be returned to the fracture from the 
%matrix with the same ''distribution coefficient`` with which they entered the rock matrix . 

% One way to model sorption is by assuming a linear isotherm. What does that mean? 
% \cite{ahn_thesis_pg20}

% The concentration of sorbed contaminant onto the fracture surface can be demonstrated in terms of 
% a rate equation (if surface diffusion is neglected.) (What is surface diffusion?) 
% \cite{ahn_thesis_pg20)

% Ahn finds that including sorption, the concentration of contaminant in the fracture satisfies the 
% differential rate equation:
% 
% \begin{align*}
% R_f\frac{\partial N}{\partial t} + \nu \frac{\partial N}{\partial z} - D \frac{\partial^2 
% D}{\partial z^2} + R_f \lambda N + \frac{q}{b} = 0, z>0 and t>0
% \end{align*}
%  
% 


% Also, there is sorption through the pores in the matrix. Again, we can model this with a ``linear 
% sorption isotherm. . . '' whatever that is.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Analytical Heat Transport %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{Analytical Models of Heat Transport}\label{sec:analytical_heat}

\subsection{Impact of Repository Designs}

\subsection{Heat Limits in Various Geologies}

\paragraph{Unsaturated Tuff}

Two heat load constraints primarily determine the heat-based SNF capacity limit in the Yucca 
Mountain Repository design, which is located in unsaturated tuff. Thermal limits in that design are intended to passively steward 
the repository's integrity against radionuclide release for the upcoming 10,000 years.

The first constraint intends to prevent repository flooding and subsequent contaminated water flow 
through the repository. It requires that the minimum temperature in the granite tuff between drifts 
be no more than the boiling temperature of water which, at the altitude in question, is 
$96^{\circ}C$. This is effectively a limit on the temperature halfway between adjacent drifts, where 
the temperature will be at a minimum.

The second constraint intends to prevent high rock temperatures that induce fractures and would 
increase leach rates. It states that no part of the rock reach a temperature above $200^{\circ}C$, 
and is effectively a limit on the temperature at the drift wall, where the rock temperature is a 
maximum.  

\subsection{Specific Temperature Integral}

Line loading ($t/m$) and areal power density ($W/km^2$) are two common metrics for describing the 
fullness of the repository. While these metrics are informative for mass capacity and power capacity 
respectively, they fail to reflect differences in thermal behavior due to varying SNF compositions.  
A closer look at the isotopics of the situtation has proven much more applicable to thermal 
performance studies of the repository, and the preferred method in the current literature relies on 
specific temperature integrals.


Specific Temperature Integrals model the thermal source as linear along the repository 
drifts, similar to the line loading and areal power density metrics. However, a temperate integral 
takes account of heat transfer behavior in the rock, includes the effects of myriad SNF 
compositions, and gives the thermal integration over time for any specific location within the rock.  
Man-Sung Yim calls this the Specific Temperature Increase method\cite{YimSTI} though other 
researchers have other names for this method. Tracy Radel calls her temperature metric at a point in 
the rock the Specific Temperature Change.\cite{radel_repository_2007}

In a repository with linear drifts, the Heat flux from the drifts can be expressed as the superposition of the linear heat flux 
contributions of all the radionuclides in the waste. Each radionuclide contributes in proportion to 
its decay heat generation and its weight fraction of the SNF. With information about isotopic 
composition of the SNF, the Specific Temperature Increase can determine the maximum thermal capacity 
of the repository in terms of tonnes/m. The length based accounting in $\frac{t}{m}$ is converted to 
$\frac{t}{Repository}$ by multiplication with the total emplacement tunnel length of the repository. 
In the case of Yucca Mountain, this was 67 km.

\section{System Level Analyses of Repository Performance} 

Fuel cycle sensitivity analyses emphasizing used fuel disposition and wastie management in the Yucca 
Mountain Repository (YMR) have been conducted by Li, Piet, Wilson, and Ahn. With a focus on YMR 
capacity benefit, repository performance metrics of interest for these analyses were heat, source 
term, and more global envrionmental impact metrics. Sensitivity analyses for other geologies were 
conducted concerning repository concepts relevant to other nations as well. See Table \ref{tab:red}.

The statutory limit of once-through, thermal PWR waste is 70,000 tonnes SNF. That is to say, the 
statutory line load limit is approximately 1.04 tonnes/m for 67km of planned emplacement tunnels 
(with 81 meters between drifts). The Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste Management Science and 
Engineering Report gives this basic ``statutory limit", but suggests an inherent design flexibility 
that could allow for expansion. The ``full inventory" Yucca Mountain design alternative gives a 
maximum repository capacity of 97,000 tonnes. In addition, the current design for the repository has 
flexibility for ``additional repository capacity" which would give a 119,000 tonne capacity at 1.04 
tonnes/m.\cite{OCRWMSciEng} 

Specific Temperature Change analysis by Radel, Wilson, et al. find a maximum thermal capcity of 1.09 
tonnes/m for commercial SNF (at an ELF of $49 GWd_{th}/m$).\cite{radel_effect_2007} 

Elongation of cooling times has the potential to expand the capacity of the repository. `Cooling 
time' refers to delaying complete loading of the repository. Longer cooling times allow high heat, 
short lived isotopes to decay to lower activity before they begin to heat the repository. Much of 
the benefit to repository capacity comes from the advantage that the cooling time allows a decrease 
in the space between emplacement drifts. Aged SNF has lower heat flux and so, the drift spacing can 
be decreased from 81 to 70 meters. A study by Man-Sung Yim and colleagues at North Carolina state 
found that for a representative commercial SNF composition a cooling time of 75 years allows for 
over 100 MTU SNF disposal without expanding the Yucca Mountain footprint.\cite{li_examining_2007}

Similarly, age based fuel mixing also allows for decreases in drift spacing. In aged based fuel 
mixing, aged (long cool time) SNF is loaded in a mixture with young SNF. This age based fuel mixing 
has been shown to achieve a $48\%$ increase in the repository capacity as constrained by heat 
load.\cite{nicholson_thermal_2007} This factor uses a fiducial default footprint of $4.6 km^2$ used 
in the NRC TSPA. The reported $48\%$ increase in capacity results in total repository capacity of 
103,600 tonnes.\cite{williams_contract_2001}

In addition to variable drift spacing, other modifications to repository layout have had promising 
results in terms of heat-limited repository capacity. The Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) 
in their Room at the Mountain study found that with redesign of the repository an increased capacity 
of at least $400\%$ (295 tonnes once-through SNF) and up to $900\%$ (663 tonnes) could be expected 
to be achieved. Proposed design changes include decreased spacing between drifts, a larger areal 
footprint, vertical expansion into second and third levels of repository space, and hybrid solutions 
involving combinations of these ideas. In particular, EPRI suggests either an expansion of the 
footprint with redesign of the current Upper Block line load design plan or a multi-level plan that 
repeats the footprint and line load design of the current plan.\cite{kessler_room_2006}

\input{litrev/footprint_tab}

\subsection{Radiotoxicity and Source Term Constraints}

The exposure limit set by the NRC is based on a `reasonably exposed individual.' That is to say, the 
limiting case is a person who lives, grows food, drinks water and breathes air 18 km downstream from 
the repository. The Yucca Mountain Repository legistlative regulations limit total dose from the 
repository to 15 mrem/yr, and limit dose from drinking water to 4 mrem/yr. Predictions of that dose 
rate depend on an enormous variety of factors. The primary pathway of radionuclides from an 
accidental release will be from cracking aged canisters. Transport of the radionuclides to the water 
table requires that the leakages come in contact with water and travel through the rock the water 
table. This results in contamination of drinking water downstream.  

\subsection{Radiotoxicity and Source Term Metrics}

Source term is a measure of the quantity of a radionuclide released into the environment and 
radiotoxicity is a measure of the hazardous effect of that particular radionuclide upon human 
ingestion. In particular, radiotoxicity is measured in terms of the volume of water dilution 
required to make it safe to ingest. Studies of source term and radiotoxicity therefore make 
probabilistic assessments of radionuclide release, transport, and human exposure. The probabilistic 
nature of these assessments mean a direct dependence of source term on repository capacity can be 
difficult to arrive at. In order to give informative values for the risk associated with transport 
of particular radionuclides, for example, studies make hundred thousand year predictions about waste 
form degredation, water flow, etc.  

A generalized metric of probablistic risk is fairly difficult to arrive at. The Peak Environmental 
Impact metric from Berkeley \cite{bouvier_comparison_2007}, for example, is a complicated function 
of spent fuel composition, waste conditioning, vitrification method, and radionuclide transport 
through the repository walls and rock. Also, it makes the assumption that the waste canisters have 
been breached at $t=0$. Furthermore, reported in $m^3$, PEI is a measure of radiotoxicity in the 
environment in the event of total breach. While informative, this model on its own does not 
completely determine a source-term limited maximum repository capacity. Additional waste package 
failure and exposed individual radiotoxicity constraints must be incorporated into it.

\subsection{Current Wisdom}
It has been shown with a great degree of uncertainty ($~50\%$) that the peak dose rate from a full, 
base case repository will occur in 300,000 years, and will reach no greater than 2.6 
mrem/yr.\cite{li_methodology_2006}

The Total System Performance Assessment on the other hand conservatively predicts a peak mean dose 
rate in the first million years (where the peak occurs at approximately 300,000 years) to be on the 
order of 150 mrem/yr.\cite{williams_contract_2001} 

Due to the incredible time scale and intrinsic uncertainties required in the probabilistic 
assessment it is in general not advisable to base any maximum repository capacity estimates on 
source term. However, source term is a useful metric for the comparison of alternative separations 
and fuel cycle scenarios.

\subsection{Factors Affecting Source Term}
A source term model will incorporate waste package failure rate, nuclide dissolution rate, and 
advective transfer rate. Waste package failure rate depends on near field environmental factors such 
as pH and humidity as well as decay heat and radiative damage anticipated from the contained waste.  
In turn, the nuclide release rate from the waste package depends on the character of the waste form 
matrix, treatment of water flow, nuclide solubility and the elemental diffusion constant. Similarly, 
advective transfer through the granite tuff also depends on water flow, nuclide solubility, and 
nuclide diffusion, but is employed in the context of the hydrogeology of the rock.   

\paragraph{Waste package failure rate} varies between models. While some employ a simulation code 
called EBSFAIL, a part of the EBSPAC module used in the TSPA code, other models incorporate their 
own hydrogeologic approximations of canister degredation, and still others assume immediate waste 
canister failure in order to focus on dissolution and transfer.  \newline

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\paragraph{Nuclide dissolution rate} can also be understood as nuclide release rate from the waste 
packages, and is the rate of mass transfer of a nuclide from its waste matrix into the saturation 
water. Models calculating  nuclide dissolution rate have assumed waste package failure insofar as 
the water is assumed to saturate the waste matrix. The mode of water flowthrough heavily effects 
nuclide dissolution rate and is treated differently in various models. While some, inspired by the 
TSP assessment, assume water moves through the waste packages at a constant volumetric rate 
(`flowthrough model'), others adopt less conservative assumptions incorporating weather based 
predictions of hydrogeologic activity. as directly proportional to the nuclide concentration in some 
cases,  \paragraph{Advective transfer rate} through the granite tuff is dependent upon diffusion 
through the rock as well as water speed, etc. The diffusion coefficient varies per nuclide and is 
heavily dependent upon the concentration of that nuclide in the flowthrough water. This is just 
Fick's First Law.  \begin{equation}
J = -D\frac{\delta\phi}{\delta x}
\end{equation}

\paragraph{Source term dependence on concentration} has a significant effect on potential repository 
capacity. Sensitivity to concentration complicates the viability of alternate loading schemes as 
well as waste separation scenarios. Radionuclide concentration has been shown to be proportional to 
the waste package loading configuration.\cite{ahn_relationship_2002,kawasaki_congruent_2004}

The dissolution rate and the advective transfer rate of a nuclide through granite tuff are typically 
be taken to depend directly upon the diffusion coefficient of that nuclide, which for some nuclides 
is heavily dependent upon the concentration of that nuclide relative to the flowthrough water. 

\subsubsection{Ahn Models (\cite{ahn_environmental_2004, ahn_environmental_2007})}

\paragraph{Basic Flowthrough Path}
Waste canisters are modelled as compartments of waste matrix surrounded by a buffer layer which is 
in turn surrounded by layers of near field rock and far field rock. Water is introduced to the 
system at a constant rate, and encounters an array of failed waste packages (at $t=0$ in the 2004 
model, and at $T_f=75,000$ years in the 2007 model). The water immediately begins dissolving the 
waste matrix. Nuclides with higher solubilities are preferentially dissolved and treated with a 
`congruent release' model discussed below. Nuclides with lower solubilities are transported through 
the buffer with the alternative `solubility limited release model. The water flow begins at one 
waste package and travels through the matrix and buffer space to the next waste package, contacting 
each waste package consecutively and then flowing on into the near field. In this way, the water is 
increasingly contaminated as its path through the waste packages proceeds.  \paragraph{Congruent 
Release Model} Nuclides with a high solubility coefficient are modeled with the congruent release 
model. Nuclides of this type include most of the fission products, but not the actinides. This model 
states that the release from the waste packages is congruent with the dissolution of the waste 
matrix and is transported through the rock by advective transfer with the water that flows through 
the waste packages.  \paragraph{Solubility Limited Release Model}
Nuclides with lower solubility coefficients are modeled with the solubility limited release model.  
Solubility values are assumed from TSPA for this model, and a solubility of $~5\times 1^{-2} 
[mol/m^3]$ are taken to be `low.' Elements in this `low' category include the toxic actinides such 
as Zr, Nb, Sn, Th, and Ra. This model suggests that a dominant mode of dissolution of the nuclide 
into the flowthrough water is dominated instead by the diffusion coefficient, which is largely 
dependent upon the concentration gradient between the waste matrix and the water. The mass balance 
driving nuclide release takes the form:
\begin{equation}
\dot{m_i}=8\epsilon D_eS_iL\sqrt{\frac{Ur_0}{\pi D_e}}
\end{equation}
where $\epsilon$, U, $r_0$, and L are the geometric and hydrogeologic factors porosity, water 
velocity, waste package radius, and waste package length, repsectively. $D_e$ is the diffusion 
coefficient ($m^2/yr$) of the element \emph{e} and $S_i$ is the isotope's solubility ($kg/m^3$).

\subsubsection{Li Model\cite{li_methodology_2006}}

\paragraph{Basic Flowthrough Path}
As a function of time, water enters the Engineered Barrier System and corrodes the waste packages.  
These fail and from the failed waste packages nuclides are released according to advective transfer.  
Further transportation through the near and far field rock medium is modeled in two modes, one 
representing the Unsaturated Zone, and one representing the Saturated Zone.

\paragraph{Waste package failure and nuclide release} are modeled with two TSPA code modules called 
EBSFAIL and EPSREL. The waste package failure rate is determined from EBSFAIL which incorporates 
waste form chemistry, humidity, oxidation, etc and upon contact from water begins the degradation 
process. The results of EBSFAIL become the input to EBSREL which models corresponding nuclide 
release from those failed waste packages. Mass balance governing the nuclide release rate in this 
model allows advective transfer to dominate and takes the form:
\begin{equation}
\dot{m_i}=w_{li}(t)-w_{ci}{t}-m_i\lambda_i+m_{i-1}\lambda_{i-1}\nonumber
\end{equation}
In this expression, $w_{li}(t)$ is the rate $[mol/yr]$ of isotope \emph{i} leached into the water.  
It is a function of water flow rate, chemistry, and isotope solubility. $m_i$ describes the mass of 
isotope \emph{i}, and $\lambda_i$ describes its decay constant. Finally, $w_{ci}(t)$ describes the 
advective transfer rate $[mol/yr]$ of the isotope \emph{i}. This model defines $w_{ci}$ as:
\begin{equation}
w_{ci}(t)=C_i(t)q_{out}(t)
\end{equation} where $q_out$ is the volumetric flow rate of the water $[m^3/yr]$, and $C_i = 
m_i/V_{wp}$ in $[mol/m^3]$. These assumptions fail to take into account any differences in the 
varying solubilities of the isotopes, but are quite sensitive to the concentration of an isotope 
\emph{i} in the waste package volume.  

\paragraph{The Unsaturated Zone} lies between the repository and the water table. This model 
describes transport time in the porous rock as:
\begin{equation}
T_a= \frac{X_u}{U_u}R_{du}
\end{equation}
where X is length of the unsaturated zone, U is the pore velocity of the water $[m/yr]$ and $R_{iu}$ 
is the retardation factor for the isotope \emph{i}. The retardation factor is poorly described here, 
but in general denotes migration distance of the solute over that of the solvent. Presumably, this 
factor incorporates isotope specific characteristics and is independent of or weakly dependent on 
concentration.  

\paragraph{The Saturated Zone} lies below the water table. At this point, the nuclide transport is 
taken to be completely advective, nuclide independent, and congruent with the volumetric flow of the 
water within the water table. 

\subsection{Independent Fuel Cycle Parameters}
Independent fuel cycle parameters of particular interest in fuel cycle systems analysis have been 
those related to the front end of the fuel cycle. Deployment decisions concerning reactor types, 
fast to thermal reactor ratios, and burnup rates can all be independently varied in fuel cycle 
simulation codes in such a way as to inform domestic policy decisiong going forward. A Some of these 
parameters are coupled, however, to aspects of the back end of the fuel cycle. For example, the 
appropriate fast reactor ratio is significantly altered by the chosen method and magnitude of 
domestic spent fuel reprocessing (or not).

However, independent variables representing decisions concerning the back end of the fuel cycle are 
of increasing interest as the United States further investigates repository alternatives to Yucca 
Mountain. Parameters such as the repository geology, tunnel design, and appropriate loading 
strategies and schedule are all independent variables up for debate. That said, some of these 
parameters are coupled with decisions about the fuel cycle. 

The point then, is that while independent parameters can be chosen and varied within a fuel cycle 
simulation, some parameters are coupled in such a way as to require full synthesis with a systems 
analysis code that appropriately determines the isotpic mass flows into the repository, their 
appropriate conditioning, densities, and other physical properties.

\subsection{Models Incorporated into Systems Analysis Codes}


%%%% FIX THIS TO AVOID PLAIGARIZING!! %%
To date, most of these top-level simulators ignore the waste disposal phase entirely and simply 
report a metric that measures the accumulated spent nuclear fuel and other wastes without 
considering the impact of those waste streams on the performance of the geologic disposal system.  A 
wider variety of waste management metrics will be necessary to fully inform the decision making 
process, especially metrics that depend on the performance of the geologic disposal system.  A model 
for repository capacity was developed for the VISION fuel cycle simulator [3] and recent efforts on 
the NUWASTE simulator [4] have made some progress in addressing this deficiency, but many similar 
efforts are lacking in this regard.  The DOE-NE Fuel Cycle Technology (FCT) program has three groups 
of relevance to this effort.  These are the FCT Used Fuel Disposition (UFD), the Separations/Waste 
Form (SWF), and System Analysis (SA) campaigns.  The SA campaign is developing the overall fuel 
cycle simulation tools and interfaces with the other FCT campaigns, including UFD.  The UFD campaign 
is conducting the RD\&D related to the storage, transportation, and disposal of radioactive wastes 
generated under both the current and potential advanced fuel cycles.  The SWF campaign is conducting 
RD\&D on potential waste forms that could be used to effectively isolate the wastes that would be 
generated in advanced fuel cycles.  The SWF and UFD campaigns are developing the fundamental tools 
and information base regarding the performance of waste forms and geologic disposal systems.  This 
effort will interface with those campaigns to utilize the tools and information to develop the 
higher-level dominant physics representations for use in fuel cycle system analysis tools.  The 
scope of work encompasses the implementation of a comprehensive software library of medium fidelity 
models to represent the thermal behavior and long-term disposal system performance of different 
disposal system concepts in different geologic media for deployment in a modular systems analysis 
platform.  This work will leverage upon previous work by the lead institution (Lead) to model 
repository behavior as a function of the contents of the waste as well as recent developments by the 
Lead to modularly incorporate dominant physics process models into a computational fuel cycle 
analysis platform.  It will also rely on conceptual framework development and primary data 
collection underway at the primary partner institution (Partner) and through interfaces with the FCT 
program participants (Partner).  This integrated simulation tool will be demonstrated with

\section{Geochemical Migration Models}
% Some mathematical models describing aqueous isotope transport in geologic settings are available 
% absent of Engineered Barier Systems and the like. These solely model host rock transport.  
% ``PHREEQC version 2 is a computer program written in the C programming language that is designed 
% to perform a wide variety of low-temperature aqueous geochemical calculations. PHREEQC is based on 
% an ion-association aqueous model and has capabilities for (1) speciation and saturation-index 
% calculations; (2) batch-reaction and one-dimensional (1D) transport calculations involving 
% reversible reactions, which include aqueous, mineral, gas, solid-solution, surface-complexation, 
% and ion-exchange equilibria, and irreversible reactions, which include specified mole transfers of 
% reactants, kinetically controlled reactions, mixing of solutions, and temperature changes; and (3) 
% inverse modeling, which finds sets of mineral and gas mole transfers that account for differences 
% in composition between waters, within specified compositional uncertainty limits.''
% GTMCHEM — a simulation environment which “deterministically” models the one-dimensional migration 
% of radionuclides through the geosphere up to the biosphere. Focusing on scenario and parametric 
% uncertainty, we show that mean predicted maximum doses to humans on the earth's surface due to 
% 1–129, and uncertainty bands around those predictions, are larger when scenario uncertainty is 
% properly assessed and propagated. .
% Things to ask about each of them include:
% Which geologies do they model?
% How long do they take to run?  Are they proprietary?  How well validated are they?
\section{Waste Form Models}
\subsection{TAD Canisters}
% The canisters proposed for transportation, aging and disposal are called TAD canisters.  They are 
% two concentric cylinders of steel and alloy22 inside and out respectively. 
\subsection{Borosilicate Glass}
% Current borosilicate glass: Includes processing chemicals from original separations, with U/Pu 
% removed, but minor actinides and Cs/Sr remaining
% Potential borosilicate glass: No minor actinides and/or no Cs/Sr; Mo may be removed to increase 
% glass loading of radionuclides; it has alower volumetric heat rate
\subsection{Glass Ceramic}
% Glass Ceramic:  This is glass-bonded sodalite from Echem processing of EBR-II, and from potential 
% future Echem processing of oxide fuels o Metal Alloy: This includes subcategories
\subsection{Metal Alloy}
% Metal alloy from Echem: Includes cladding as well as noble metals that did not dissolve in the 
% Echem dissolution
% Metal alloy from aqueous reprocessing:  Includes undissolved solids and transition metal fission 
% products
\subsection{Advanced Ceramic}
% Advanced Ceramic: An advanced waste form that includes iodine volatilized during chopping, which 
% is then gettered during head-end processing of used fuels
\subsection{Separated Streams}
% Other:  Examples include radionuclides removed from other waste forms (e.g., Cs/Sr, I, C), as well 
% as new waste forms such as a salt waste form
\subsection{Classes A, B, and C waste}
% Lower Than High Level Waste (LTHLW): Includes Classes A, B, and C
\subsection{GTCC LTHLW}
% Greater Than Class C (GTCC)
